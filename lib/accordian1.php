        <div>
            <p>
                KEEPING STILL. Keeping his back still |So that he no longer feels his body. He goes into his courtyard And does not see his people. |No blame.</p>
            <p>Commentary an Explanation of the Judgement</p>
            <p>True quiet means keeping still when the time has come to keep still, andgoing forward when the time has come to go forward. In this way rest andmovement are in agreement with the demands of the time, and thus there islight in life. The hexagram signifies the end and the beginning of allmovement. The back is named because in the back are located all the nervefibers that mediate movement. If the movement of these spinal nerves isbrought to a standstill, the ego, with its restlessness, disappears as itwere. When a man has thus become calm, he may turn to the outside world. He nolonger sees in it the struggle and tumult of individual beings, and thereforehe has that true peace of mind which is needed for understanding the greatlaws of the universe and for acting in harmony with them. Whoever acts fromthese deep levels makes no mistakes.        </p>

                Explanation of the Trigrams
                <p>
                    The image of this hexagram is the mountain, the youngest son of heaven andearth. The male principle is at the top because it strives upward by nature;the female principle is below, since the direction of its movement has come toits normal end. In its application to man, the hexagram turns upon the problemof achieving a quiet heart. It is very difficult to bring quiet to the heart.While Buddhism strives for rest through an ebbing away of all movement innirvana, the Book of Changes holds that rest is merely a state of polaritythat always posits movement as its complement. Possibly the words of the textembody directions for the practice of yoga.

                    The Ancient Assocated Image
                <p>
                    Thunder in the middle of the lake: The image of FOLLOWING. Thus the superior man at nightfall Goes indoors for rest and recuperation.
                <p>
                    Commentary and Explanation of the Image
                <p>

                    In the autumn electricity withdraws into the earth again and rests. Here itis the thunder in the middle of the lake that serves as the image--thunder inits winter rest, not thunder in motion. The idea of following in the sense ofadaptation to the demands of the time grows out of this image. Thunder in themiddle of the lake indicates times of darkness and rest. Similarly, a superiorman, after being tirelessly active all day, allows himself rest andrecuperation at night. No situation can become favorable until one is able toadapt to it and does not wear himself out with mistaken resistance.
