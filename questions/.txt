However, as applied to human affairs,the principle of this complementary relationship is found not only in therelation between man and woman, but also in that between prince and ministerand between father and son. Indeed, even in the individual this dualityappears in the coexistence of the spiritual world and the world of the senses.But strictly speaking there is no real dualism here, because there is aclearly defined hierarchic relationship between the two principles. In itselfof course the Receptive is just as important as the Creative, but theattribute of devotion defines the place occupied by this primal power inrelation to the Creative. For the Receptive must be activated and led by theCreative; then it is productive of good. Only when it abandons this positionand tries to stand as an equal side by side with the Creative, does it becomeevil. The result then is opposition to and struggle against the Creative,which is productive of evil to both.",

Applied to human affairs, therefore, what the hexagram indicated isaction in conformity with the situation. The person in questions not in anindependent position, but is acting as an assistant. This means that he mustachieve something. It is not his task to try to lead--that would only make himlose the way-but to let himself be led. If he knows how to meet fate with anattitude of acceptance, he is sure to find the right guidance. The superiorman lets himself be guided; he does not go ahead blindly, but learns from thesituation what is demanded of him and then follows this intimation from fate.Since there is something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers inthe hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized are firmly set. Thetime of toil and effort is indicated by the west and south, for west and southsymbolize the place where the Receptive works for the Creative, as nature doesin summer and autumn. If in that situation one does not mobilize all one'spowers, the work to be accomplished will not be done. Hence to find friendsthere means to find guidance. But in addition to the time of toil and effort,there is also a time of planning, and for this we need this solitude.
