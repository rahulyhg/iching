13. T'ung Jen / Fellowship with Men

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN  below LI THE CLINGING, FLAME

</div><div class="explanation">
 The image of the upper trigram Ch'ien is heaven, and that of the lower, Li,is flame. It is the nature of fire to flame up to the heaven. This gives theidea of fellowship. IT is the second line that, by virtue of its centralcharacter, unites the five strong lines around it. This hexagram forms acomplement to Shih, THE ARMY<p> 7. In the latter, danger is within and obedience without--the character of awarlike army, which, in order to hold together, needs one strong man among themany who are weak. Here, clarity is within and strength without--the characterof a peaceful union of men, which, in order to hold together, needs oneyielding nature among many firm persons.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 FELLOWSHIP WITH MEN in the open.  Success.  It furthers one to cross the great water.  The perseverance of the superior man furthers.

</div><div class="explanation">
 True fellowship among men must be based upon a concern that is universal. Itis not the private interests of the individual that create lasting fellowshipamong men, but rather the goals of humanity. That is why it is said thatfellowship with men in the open succeeds. If unity of this kind prevails, evendifficult and dangerous tasks, such as crossing the great water, can beaccomplished. But in order to bring about this sort of fellowship, apersevering and enlightened leader is needed--a man with clear, convincing,and inspiring aims and the strength to carry them out. (The inner trigrammeans clarity; the outer, strength.)

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Heaven together with fire: The image of FELLOWSHIP WITH MEN.  Thus the superior man organizes the clans  And makes distinctions between things.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Heaven has the same direction of movement as fire, yet it is different fromfire. Just as the luminaries in the sky serve for the systematic division andarrangement of time, so human society and all things that really belongtogether must be organically arranged. Fellowship should not be a meremingling of individuals or of things--that would be chaos, not fellowship. Iffellowship is to lead to order, there must be organization within diversity.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Nine at the beginning means: <p>Fellowship with men at the gate.  No blame.<p> The beginning of union among people should take place before the door. Allare equally close to one another. No divergent aims have yet arisen, and onemakes not mistakes. The basic principles of any kind of union must be equallyaccessible to all concerned. Secret agreements bring misfortune.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>Fellowship with men in the clan.  Humiliation.<p> There is danger here of formation of a separate faction on the basis ofpersonal and egotistic interests. Such factions, which are exclusive and,instead of welcoming all men, must condemn one group in order to unite theothers, originate from low motives and therefore lead in the course of time tohumiliation.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>He hides weapons in the thicket;  He climbs the high hill in front of it.  For three years he does not rise up.<p> Here fellowship has changed about to mistrust. Each man distrusts the other,plans a secret ambush, and seeks to spy on his fellow form afar. We aredealing with an obstinate opponent whom we cannot come at by this method.Obstacles standing in the way of fellowship with others are shown here. Onehas mental reservations for one's own part and seeks to take his opponent bysurprise. This very fact makes one mistrustful, suspecting the same wiles inhis opponent and trying to ferret them out. The result is that one departsfurther and further from true fellowship. The longer this goes on, the morealienated one becomes.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Nine in the fourth place means: <p>He climbs up on his wall; he cannot attack.  Good fortune.<p> Here the reconciliation that follows quarrel mover nearer. It is true thatthere are still dividing walls on which we stand confronting one another. Butthe difficulties are too great. We get into straits, and this brings us to oursenses. We cannot fight, and therein lies our good fortune.

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Nine in the fifth place means: <p>Men bound in fellowship first weep and lament,  But afterward they laugh.  After great struggles they succeed in meeting.<p> Two people are outwardly separated, but in their hearts they are united.They are kept apart by their positions in life. Many difficulties andobstructions arise between them and cause them grief. But, remaining true toeach other, the allow nothing to separate them, and although it costs them asevere struggle to overcome the obstacles, they will succeed. When they cometogether their sadness will change to joy. Confucius says of this: <p> Life leads the thoughtful man on a path of many windings.Now the course ischecked, now it runs straight again.Here winged thoughts may pour freely forthin words,There the heavy burden of knowledge must be shut away in silence.Butwhen two people are at one in the inmost hearts,They shatter even the strengthof iron or of bronze.And when two people understand each other in their inmosthearts,Their words are sweet and strong, like the fragrance of orchids.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Nine at the top means: <p>Fellowship with men in the meadow.  No remorse.<p> The warm attachment that springs from the heart is lacking here. We are bythis time actually outside of fellowship with others. However, we allyourselves with them. The fellowship does not include all, but only those whohappen to dwell near one another. The meadow is the pasture at the entrance tothe town. At this stage, the ultimate goal of the union of mankind has not yetbeen attained, but we need not reproach ourselves. We join the communitywithout separate aims of our own.
