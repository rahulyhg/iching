      The dark lines are about to mount upward and overthrow the
      last firm, lightline by exerting a disintegrating influence
      on it. The inferior, dark forcesovercome what is superior and
      strong, not by direct means, but by underminingit gradually
      and imperceptibly, so that it finally collapses. The lines of
      thehexagram present the image of a house, the top line being
      the roof, andbecause the roof is being shattered the house
      collapses. The hexagram belongsto the ninth month
      (October-November). The yin power pushes up ever
      morepowerfully and is about to supplant the yang power
      altogether.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      SPLITTING APART. IT does not further one To go anywhere.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      This pictures a time when inferior people are pushing forward
      and are aboutto crowd out the few remaining strong and
      superior men. Under thesecircumstances, which are due to the
      time, it is not favorable for the superiorman to undertake
      anything. The right behavior in such adverse times is to
      bededuced from the images and their attributes. The lower
      trigram stands for theearth, whose attributes. The lower
      trigram stands for the earth, whoseattributes are docility
      and devotion. The upper trigram stands for themountain, whose
      attribute is stillness. This suggests that one should
      submitto the bad time and remain quiet. For it is a question
      not of man's doing butof time conditions, which, according to
      the laws of heaven, show analternation of increase and
      decrease, fullness and emptiness. It is impossibleto
      counteract these conditions of the time. Hence it is not
      cowardice butwisdom to submit and avoid action.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      The mountain rests on the earth: The image of SPLITTING
      APART. Thus those above can ensure their position Only by
      giving generously to those below.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The mountain rests on the earth. When it is steep and narrow,
      lacking abroad base, it must topple over. Its position is
      strong only when it rises outof the earth broad and great,
      not proud and steep. So likewise those who rulerest on the
      broad foundation of the people. They too should be generous
      andbenevolent, like the earth that carries all. Then they
      will make theirposition as secure as a mountain is in its
      tranquillity.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>The leg of the bed is split. Those who persevere are
      destroyed. Misfortune.</p>
      <p>Inferior people are on the rise and stealthily begin their
      destructiveburrowing from below in order to undermine the
      place where the superior manrests. Those followers of the
      ruler who remain loyal are destroyed by slanderand intrigue.
      The situation bodes disaster, yet there is nothing to do
      butwait.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Six in the second place means:
      <p>The bed is split at the edge. Those who persevere are
      destroyed. Misfortune.</p>
      <p>The power of the inferior people is growing. The danger
      draws close to one'sperson; already there are clear
      indication, and rest is disturbed. Moreover,in this dangerous
      situation one is as yet without help or friendly advancesfrom
      above or below. Extreme caution is necessary in this
      isolation. One mustadjust to the time and promptly avoid the
      danger. Stubborn perseverance inmaintaining one's standpoint
      would lead to downfall.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>He splits with them. No blame.</p>
      <p>An individual finds himself in an evil environment to
      which he is committedby external ties. But he has an inner
      relationship with a superior man, andthrough this he attains
      the stability to free himself from the way of theinferior
      people around him. This brings him into opposition to them of
      course,but that is not wrong.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Six in the fourth place means:
      <p>The bed is split up to the skin. Misfortune.</p>
      <p>Here the disaster affects not only the resting place but
      even the occupant.No warning or other comment is added.
      Misfortune has reached its peak: it canno longer be warded
      off.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>A shoal of fishes. Favor comes through the court ladies.
      Everything acts to further.</p>
      <p>Here, in immediate proximity to the strong, light-giving
      principle at the top, the nature of the dark force undergoes
      a change. It no longer opposes thestrong principle by means
      of intrigues but submits to its guidance. Indeed, asthe head
      of the other weak lines, it leads all of these to the strong
      line,just as a princess leads her maids-in-waiting like a
      shoal of fishes to herhusband and thus gains his favor.
      Inasmuch as the lower element thusvoluntarily places itself
      under the higher, it attains happiness and thehigher also
      receives its due. Therefore all goes well.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Nine at the top means:
      <p>There is a large fruit still uneaten. The superior man
      receives a carriage. The house of the inferior man is split
      apart.</p>
      <p>Here the splitting apart reaches its end. When misfortune
      has spent itself,better times return. The seed of the good
      remains, and it is just when thefruit falls to the ground
      that food sprouts anew from its seed. The superiorman again
      attains influence and effectiveness. He is supported by
      publicopinion as if in a carriage. But the inferior man's
      wickedness is visited uponhimself. His house is split apart.
      A law of nature is at work here. Evil isnot destructive to
      the good alone but inevitably destroys itself as well.
      Forevil, which lives solely by negation, cannot continue to
      exist on its ownstrength alone. The inferior man himself
      fares best when held under control bya superior man.</p>
