      49. Ko / Revolution (Molting)
    </div>
    <div class="trigrams">
      above TUI THE JOYOUS, LAKE below LI THE CLINGING, FIRE
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The Chinese character for this hexagram means in its original
      sense ananimal's pelt, which is changed in the course of the
      year by molting. Fromthis word is carried over to apply to
      the "moltings" in political life, thegreat revolutions
      connected with changes of governments. The two trigramsmaking
      up the hexagram are the same two that appear in K'uei,
      OPPOSITION
      <p>38, that is, the two younger daughters, Li and Tui. But
      while there theelder of the two daughters is above, and what
      results is essentially only anopposition of tendencies, here
      the younger daughter is above. The influencesare in actual
      conflict, and the forces combat each other like fire and
      water(lake), each trying to destroy the other. Hence the idea
      of revolution.</p>

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      REVOLUTION. On your own day You are believed.
      <p>Supreme success, Furthering through perseverance. Remorse
      disappears.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Political revolutions are extremely grave matters. They
      should be undertakenonly under stress of direst necessity,
      when there is no other way out. Noteveryone is called to this
      task, but only the man who has the confidence ofthe people,
      and even he only when the time is ripe. He must then proceed
      inthe right way, so that he gladdens the people and, by
      enlightening them,prevents excesses. Furthermore, he must be
      quite free of selfish aims and mustreally relieve the need of
      the people. Only then does he have nothing toregret. Times
      change, and with them their demands. Thus the seasons change
      inthe course of the year. In the world cycle also there are
      spring and autumn inthe life of peoples and nations, and
      these call for social transformations.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Fire in the lake: the image of REVOLUTION. Thus the superior
      man Sets the calendar in order And makes the seasons clear.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Fire below and the lake above combat and destroy each other.
      So too in thecourse of the year a combat takes place between
      the forces of light and theforces of darkness, eventuating in
      the revolution of the seasons, and man isable to adjust
      himself in advance to the demands of the different times.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>Wrapped in the hide of a yellow cow.</p>
      <p>Changes ought to be undertaken only when there is nothing
      else to be done.Therefore at first the utmost restraint is
      necessary. One must becomes firm inone's mind, control
      oneself-yellow is the color of the means, and the cow isthe
      symbol of docility-and refrain from doing anything for the
      time being,because any premature offensive will bring evil
      results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Six in the second place means:
      <p>When one's own day comes, one may create revolution.</p>
      <p>Starting brings good fortune. No blame.</p>
      <p>When we have tried in every other way to bring about
      reforms, but withoutsuccess, revolution becomes necessary.
      But such a thoroughgoing upheaval mustbe carefully prepared.
      There must be available a man who has the requisiteabilities
      and who possesses public confidence. To such a man we may
      well turn.This brings good fortune and is not a mistake. The
      first thing to beconsidered is our inner attitude toward the
      new condition that will inevitablycome. We have to go out to
      meet it, as it were. Only in this way can it beprepared
      for.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Nine in the third place means:
      <p>Starting brings misfortune. Perseverance brings danger.
      When talk of revolution has gone the rounds three times, One
      may commit himself, And men will believe him.</p>
      <p>When change is necessary, there are two mistakes to be
      avoided. One lies inexcessive haste and ruthlessness, which
      bring disaster. The other lies inexcessive hesitation and
      conservatism, which are also dangerous. Not everydemand for
      change in the existing order should be heeded. On the other
      hand,repeated and well-founded complaints should not fail of
      a hearing. When talkof change has come to one's ears three
      times, and has been pondered well, hemay believe and
      acquiesce in it. Then he will meet with belief and
      willaccomplish something.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>Remorse disappears. Men believe him. Changing the form of
      government brings good fortune.</p>
      <p>Radical changes require adequate authority. A man must
      have inner strengthas well as influential position. What he
      does must correspond with a highertruth and must not spring
      from arbitrary or petty motives; then it bringsgreat good
      fortune. If a revolution is not founded on such inner truth,
      theresults are bad, and it has no success. For in the end men
      will support onlythose undertakings which they feel
      instinctively to be just.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>The great man changes like a tiger. Even before he
      questions the oracle He is believed.</p>
      <p>A tigerskin, with its highly visible black stripes on a
      yellow ground, showsits distinct pattern from afar. It is the
      same with a revolution brought aboutby a great man: large,
      clear guiding lines become visible, understandable
      toeveryone. Therefore he need not first consult the oracle,
      for he wins thespontaneous support of the people.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>The superior man changes like a panther.</p>
      <p>The inferior man molts in the face.</p>
      <p>Starting brings misfortune.</p>
      <p>To remain persevering brings good fortune.</p>
      <p>After the large and fundamental problems are settled,
      certain minor reforms,and elaborations of these, are
      necessary. These detailed reforms may belikened to the
      equally distinct but relatively small marks of the
      panther'scoat. As a consequence, a change also takes place
      among the inferior people.In conformity with the new order,
      they likewise "molt." This molting, it istrue, does not go
      very deep, but that is not to be expected. We must
      besatisfied with the attainable. If we should go too far and
      try to achieve toomuch, it would lead to unrest and
      misfortune. For the object of a greatrevolution is the
      attainment of clarified, secure conditions ensuring ageneral
      stabilization on the basis of what is possible at the
      moment.</p>
