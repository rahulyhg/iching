30. Li / The Clinging, Fire

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above LI THE CLINGING, FIRE  below LI THE CLINGING, FIRE

</div><div class="explanation">
 This hexagram is another double sign. The trigram Li means "to cling tosomething," and also "brightness." A dark line clings to two light lines, oneabove and one below--the image of an empty space between two strong lines,whereby the two strong lines are made bright. The trigram represents themiddle daughter. The Creative has incorporated the central line of theReceptive, and thus Li develops. As an image, it is fire. Fire has no definiteform but clings to the burning object and thus is bright. As water pours downfrom heaven, so fire flames up from the earth. While K'an means the soul shutwithin the body, Li stands for nature in its radiance.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 THE CLINGING. Perseverance furthers.  It brings success.  Care of the cow brings good fortune.

</div><div class="explanation">
 What is dark clings to what is light and so enhances the brightness of thelatter. A luminous thing giving out light must have within itself somethingthat perseveres; otherwise it will in time burn itself out. Everything thatgives light is dependent on something to which it clings, in order that it maycontinue to shine. Thus the sun and moon cling to heaven, and grain, grass,and trees cling to the earth. So too the twofold clarity of the dedicated manclings to what is right and thereby can shape the world. Human life on earthis conditioned and unfree, and when man recognizes this limitation and makeshimself dependent upon the harmonious and beneficent forces of the cosmos, heachieves success. The cow is the symbol of extreme docility. By cultivating inhimself an attitude of compliance and voluntary dependence, man acquiresclarity without sharpness and finds his place in the world.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 That which is bright rises twice: The image of FIRE. Thus the great man, by perpetuating this brightness,  Illumines the four quarters of the world.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Each of the two trigrams represents the sun in the course of a day. The twotogether represent the repeated movement of the sun, the function of lightwith respect to time. The great man continues the work of nature in the humanworld. Through the clarity of his nature he causes the light to spread fartherand farther and to penetrate the nature of man ever more deeply.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Nine at the beginning means: <p>The footprints run crisscross.  If one is seriously intent, no blame.<p> It is early morning and work begins. The mind has been closed to the outsideworld in sleep; now its connections with the world begin again. The traces ofone's impressions run crisscross. Activity and haste prevail. It is importantthen to preserve inner composure and not to allow oneself to be swept along bythe bustle of life. If one is serious and composed, he can acquire the clarityof mind needed for coming to terms with the innumerable impressions that pourin. It is precisely at the beginning that serious concentration is important,because the beginning holds the seed of all that is to follow. 

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>Yellow light. Supreme good fortune.<p> Midday has come; the sun shines with a yellow light. Yellow is the color ofmeasure and mean. Yellow light is therefore a symbol of the highest cultureand art, whose consummate harmony consists in holding to the mean.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>In the light of the setting sun,  Men either beat the pot and sing  Or loudly bewail the approach of old age.  Misfortune.<p> Here the end of the day has come. The light of the setting sun calls to mindthe fact that life is transitory and conditional. Caught in this externalbondage, men are usually robbed of their inner freedom as well. The sense ofthe transitoriness of life impels them to uninhibited revelry in order toenjoy life while it lasts, or else they yield to melancholy and spoil theprecious time by lamenting the approach of old age. Both attitudes are wrong.To the superior man it makes no difference whether death comes early or late.He cultivates himself, awaits his allotted time, and in this way secures hisfate.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Nine in the fourth place means: <p>Its coming is sudden;  It flames up, dies down, is thrown away.<p> Clarity of mind has the same relation to life that fire has to wood. Fireclings to wood, but also consumes it. Clarity of mind is rooted in life butcan also consume it. Everything depends upon how the clarity functions. Herethe image used is that of a meteor or a straw fire. A man who is excitable andrestless may rise quickly to prominence but produces no lasting effects. Thusmatters end badly when a man spends himself too rapidly and consumes himselflike a meteor. 

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Six in the fifth place means: <p>Tears in floods, sighing and lamenting.  Good fortune.<p> Here the zenith of life has been reached. Were there no warning, one wouldat this point consume oneself like a flame. Instead, understanding the vanityof all things, one may put aside both hope and fear, and sigh and lament: ifone is intent on retaining his clarity of mind, good fortune will come fromthis grief. For here we are dealing not with a passing mood, as in the nine inthe third place, but with a real change of heart.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Nine at the top means: <p>The king used him to march forth and chastise.<p> Then it is best to kill the leaders  And take captive the followers. No blame.<p> It is not the purpose of chastisement to impose punishment blindly but tocreate discipline. Evil must be cured at its roots. To eradicate evil inpolitical life, it is best to kill the ringleaders and spare the followers. Ineducating oneself it is best to root out bad habits and tolerate those thatare harmless. For asceticism that is too strict, like sentences of undueseverity, fails in its purpose.
