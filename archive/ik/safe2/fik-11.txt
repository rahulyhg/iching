    <div class="explanation">
      The Receptive, which moves downward, stands above; the
      Creative, which movesupward, is below. Hence their influences
      meet and are in harmony, so that allliving things bloom and
      prosper. This hexagram belongs to the first
      month(February-March), at which time the forces of nature
      prepare the new spring.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      PEACE. The small departs, The great approaches. Good fortune.
      Success.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      This hexagram denotes a time in nature when heaven seems to
      be on earth.Heaven has placed itself beneath the earth, and
      so their powers unite in deepharmony. Then peace and blessing
      descend upon all living things. In the worldof man it is a
      time of social harmony; those in high places show favor to
      thelowly, and the lowly and inferior is an end to all feuds.
      In side, at thecenter, in the key position, is the light
      principle; the dark principle isoutside. Thus the light has a
      powerful influence, while the dark issubmissive. In this way
      each receives its due. When the good elements ofsociety
      occupy a central position and are in control, the evil
      elements comeunder their influence and change for the better.
      When the spirit of heavenrules in man, his animal nature also
      comes under its influence and takes itsappropriate place. The
      individual lines enter the hexagram from below andleave it
      again at the top. Here the small, weak, and evil elements are
      aboutto take their departure, while the great, strong, and
      good elements are movingup. This brings good fortune and
      success.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Heaven and earth unite: the image of PEACE. Thus the ruler
      Divides and completes the course of heaven and earth, And so
      aids the people.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Heaven and earth are in contact and combine their influences,
      producing atime of universal flowering and prosperity. This
      stream of energy must beregulated by the ruler of men. It is
      done by a process of division. Thus mendivide the uniform
      flow of time into the seasons, according to the successionof
      natural phenomena, and mark off infinite space by the points
      of thecompass. In this way nature in its overwhelming
      profusion of phenomena isbounded and controlled. One the
      other hand, nature must be furthered in herproductiveness.
      This is done by adjusting the products to the right time
      andthe right place, which increases the natural yield. This
      controlling andfurthering activity of man in his relation to
      nature is the work on naturethat rewards him.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>When ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it.
      Each according to his kind. Undertakings bring good
      fortune.</p>
      <p>In times of prosperity every able man called to fill an
      office draws likeminded people along with him, just as in
      pulling up ribbon grass one alwayspulls up a bunch of it,
      because the stalks are connected by their roots. Insuch
      times, when it is possible to extend influence widely, the
      mind of anable man is set upon going out into life and
      accomplishing something.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>Bearing with the uncultured in gentleness, Fording the
      river with resolution, Not neglecting what is distant, Not
      regarding one's companions:</p>
      <p>Thus one may manage to walk in the middle.</p>
      <p>In times of prosperity it is important and above all to
      possess enoughgreatness of soul to bear with imperfect
      people. For in the hands of a greatmaster no material is
      unproductive; he can find use for everything. But
      thisgenerosity is by no means laxity or weakness. It is
      during times of prosperityespecially that we must always be
      ready to risk even dangerous undertakings,such as the
      crossing of a river, if they are necessary. So too we must
      notneglect what is distant but must attend scrupulously to
      everything.Factionalism and the dominance of cliques are
      especially to be avoided. Evenif people of like mind come
      forward together, they ought not to form a factionby holding
      together for mutual advantage; instead, each man should do is
      duty.Theses are four ways in which one can overcome the
      hidden danger of a gradualslackening that always lurks in any
      time of peace. And that is how one findsthe middle way for
      action.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Nine in the third place means:
      <p>No plain not followed by a slope. No going not followed by
      a return. He who remains persevering in danger Is without
      blame. Do not complain about this truth; Enjoy the good
      fortune you still possess.</p>
      <p>Everything on earth is subject to change. Prosperity is
      followed by decline:this is the eternal law on earth. Evil
      can indeed be held in check but notpermanently abolished. It
      always returns. This conviction might inductmelancholy, but
      it should not; it ought only to keep us from falling
      intoillusion when good fortune comes to us. If we continue
      mindful of the danger,we remain persevering and make no
      mistakes. As long as a man's inner natureremains stronger and
      richer than anything offered by external fortune, as longas
      he remains inwardly superior to fate, fortune will not desert
      him.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Six in the fourth place means:
      <p>He flutters down, not boasting of his wealth, Together
      with his neighbor, Guileless and sincere.</p>
      <p>In times of mutual confidence, people of high rank come in
      close contactwith the lowly quite simply and without boasting
      of their wealth. This is notdue to the force of circumstances
      but corresponds with their inmost sentiment.The approach is
      made quite spontaneously, because it is based on
      innerconviction.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means
      <p>The sovereign I Gives his daughter in marriage. And
      supreme good fortune.</p>
      <p>The sovereign I is T'ang the Completer. By his decree the
      imperialprincesses, although higher in rank than their
      husbands, had to obey them likeall other wives. Here too we
      are shown a truly modest union of high and lowthat brings
      happiness and blessings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>The wall falls back into the moat. Use no army now. Make
      your commands known within your own town. Perseverance brings
      humiliation.</p>
      <p>The change alluded to in the middle of the hexagram has
      begun to take place.The wall of the town sinks back into the
      moat from which it was dug. The hourof doom is at hand. When
      matters have come to this pass, we should submit tofate and
      not try to stave it off by violent resistance. The one
      recourse leftus is to hold our own within our intimate
      circle. Should we persevere intrying to resist the evil in
      the usual way, our collapse would only be morecomplete, and
      humiliation would be the result.</p>
