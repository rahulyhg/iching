32. Heng / Duration

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above CHEN THE AROUSING, THUNDER  below SUN THE GENTLE, WIND

</div><div class="explanation">
 The strong trigram Chen is above, the weak trigram Sun below. This hexagramis the inverse of the preceding one. In the latter we have influence, here wehave union as an enduring condition. The two images are thunder and wind,which are likewise constantly paired phenomena. The lower trigram indicatesgentleness within; the upper, movement without. In the sphere of socialrelationships, the hexagram represents the institution of marriage as theenduring union of the sexes. During courtship the young man subordinateshimself to the girl, but in marriage, which is represented by the comingtogether of the eldest son and the eldest daughter, the husband is thedirecting and moving force outside, while the wife, inside, is gentle andsubmissive.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 DURATION. Success. No blame.  Perseverance furthers.  It furthers one to have somewhere to go.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Duration is a state whose movement is not worn down by hindrances. It is nota state of rest, for mere standstill is regression. Duration is rather theself-contained and therefore self-renewing movement of an organized, firmlyintegrated whole, taking place in accordance with immutable laws and beginninganew at every ending. The end is reached by an inward movement, by inhalation,systole, contraction, and this movement turns into a new beginning, in whichthe movement is directed outward, in exhalation, diastole, expansion. Heavenlybodies exemplify duration. They move in their fixed orbits, and because ofthis their light-giving power endures. The seasons of the year follow a fixedlaw of change and transformation, hence can produce effects that endure. Solikewise the dedicated man embodies an enduring meaning in his way of life,and thereby the world is formed. In that which gives things their duration, wecan come to understand the nature of all beings in heaven and on earth.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Thunder and wind: the image of DURATION. Thus the superior man stands firm  And does not change has direction.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Thunder rolls, and the wind blows; both are examples of extreme mobility andso are seemingly the very opposite of duration, but the laws governing theirappearance and subsidence, their coming and going, endure. In the same way theindependence of the superior man is not based on rigidity and immobility ofcharacter. He always keeps abreast of the time and changes with it. Whatendures is the unswerving directive, the inner law of his being, whichdetermines all his actions.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>Seeking duration too hastily brings misfortune persistently.<p> Nothing that would further.<p> Whatever endures can be created only gradually by long-continued work andcareful reflection. In the same sense Lao-tse says: "If we wish to compresssomething, we must first let it fully expand." He who demands too much at onceis acting precipitately, and because he attempts too much, he ends bysucceeding in nothing. 

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Nine in the second place means: <p>Remorse disappears.  The situation is abnormal. A man's force of character is greater than theavailable material power. Thus he might be afraid of allowing himself toattempt something beyond his strength. However, since it is the time ofDURATION, it is possible for him to control his inner strength and so to avoidexcess. Cause for remorse then disappears.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>He who does not give duration to his character  Meets with disgrace.  Persistent humiliation.<p> If a man remains at the mercy of moods of hope or fear aroused by the outerworld, he loses his inner consistency of character. Such inconsistencyinvariably leads to distressing experiences. These humiliations often comefrom an unforeseen quarter. Such experiences are not merely effects producedby the external world, but logical consequences evoked by his own nature.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Nine in the fourth place means: <p>No game in the field.<p> If we are in pursuit of game and want to get a shot at a quarry, we must setabout it in the right way. A man who persists in stalking game in a placewhere there is none may wait forever without finding any. Persistence insearch is not enough. What is not sought in the right way is not found.

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Six in the fifth place means: <p>Giving duration to one's character through perseverance.<p> This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man.<p> A woman should follow a man her whole life long, but a man should at alltimes hold to what is his duty at the given moment. Should he persistentlyseek to conform to the woman, it would be a mistake for him. Accordingly it isaltogether right for a woman to hold conservatively to tradition, but a manmust always be flexible and adaptable and allow himself to be guided solely bywhat his duty requires of him at the moment.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Six at the top means: <p>Restlessness as an enduring condition brings misfortune.<p> There are people who live in a state of perpetual hurry without everattaininginner composure. Restlessness not only prevents all thoroughness butactuallybecomes a danger if it is dominant in places of authority.
