      2. K'un / The Receptive
    </div>
    <div class="trigrams">
      above K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH below K'UN THE RECEPTIVE,
      EARTH
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      This hexagram is made up of broken lines only. The broken
      lines representsthe dark, yielding, receptive primal power of
      yin. The attribute of thehexagram is devotion; its image is
      the earth. It is the perfect complement ofTHE CREATIVE--the
      complement, not the opposite, for the Receptive does
      notcombat the Creative but completes it . It represents
      nature in contrast tospirit, earth in contrast to heaven,
      space as against time, the female-maternal as against the
      male-paternal. However, as applied to human affairs,the
      principle of this complementary relationship is found not
      only in therelation between man and woman, but also in that
      between prince and ministerand between father and son.
      Indeed, even in the individual this dualityappears in the
      coexistence of the spiritual world and the world of the
      senses.But strictly speaking there is no real dualism here,
      because there is aclearly defined hierarchic relationship
      between the two principles. In itselfof course the Receptive
      is just as important as the Creative, but theattribute of
      devotion defines the place occupied by this primal power
      inrelation to the Creative. For the Receptive must be
      activated and led by theCreative; then it is productive of
      good. Only when it abandons this positionand tries to stand
      as an equal side by side with the Creative, does it
      becomeevil. The result then is opposition to and struggle
      against the Creative,which is productive of evil to both.

    <div class="title">
      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      THE RECEPTIVE brings about sublime success, Furthering
      through the perseverance of a mare. If the superior man
      undertakes something and tries to lead, He goes astray; But
      if he follows, he finds guidance. It is favorable to find
      friends in the west and south, To forego friends in the east
      and north. Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The four fundamental aspects of the Creative--"sublime
      success, furtheringthrough perseverance"--are also attributed
      to the Receptive. Here, however,the perseverance is more
      closely defined: it is that of a mare. The Receptiveconnotes
      spatial reality in contrast to the spiritual potentiality of
      theCreative. The potential becomes real and the spiritual
      becomes spatial througha specifically qualifying definition.
      Thus the qualification, "of a mare," ishere added to the idea
      of perseverance. The horse belongs to earth just as thedragon
      belongs to heaven. Its tireless roaming over the plains is
      taken as asymbol of the vast expanse of the earth. This is
      the symbol chosen because themare combines the strength and
      swiftness of the horse with the gentleness anddevotion of the
      cow. Only because nature in its myriad forms corresponds
      withthe myriad impulses of the Creative can it make these
      impulses real. Nature'srichness lies in its power to nourish
      all living things; its greatness lies inits power to give
      then beauty and splendor. Thus it prospers all that lives.IT
      is the Creative that begets things, but they are brought to
      birth by theReceptive. Applied to human affairs, therefore,
      what the hexagram indicated isaction in conformity with the
      situation. The person in questions not in anindependent
      position, but is acting as an assistant. This means that he
      mustachieve something. It is not his task to try to
      lead--that would only make himlose the way-but to let himself
      be led. If he knows how to meet fate with anattitude of
      acceptance, he is sure to find the right guidance. The
      superiorman lets himself be guided; he does not go ahead
      blindly, but learns from thesituation what is demanded of him
      and then follows this intimation from fate.Since there is
      something to be accomplished, we need friends and helpers
      inthe hour of toil and effort, once the ideas to be realized
      are firmly set. Thetime of toil and effort is indicated by
      the west and south, for west and southsymbolize the place
      where the Receptive works for the Creative, as nature doesin
      summer and autumn. If in that situation one does not mobilize
      all one'spowers, the work to be accomplished will not be
      done. Hence to find friendsthere means to find guidance. But
      in addition to the time of toil and effort,there is also a
      time of planning, and for this we need this solitude. The
      eastsymbolized the place where a man receives orders from his
      master, and thenorth the place where he reports on what he
      has done. At that time he must bealone and objective. In this
      sacred hour he must do without companions. Sothat the purity
      of the moment may not be spoiled by fictional hates
      andfavoritism.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      The earth's condition is receptive devotion. Thus the
      superior man who has breadth of character Carries the outer
      world.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Just as there is only one heaven, so too there is only one
      earth. In thehexagram of heaven the doubling of the trigram
      implies duration in time, butin the hexagram of earth the
      doubling connotes the solidity and extension inspace by
      virtue of which the earth is able to carry and preserve all
      thingsthat live and move upon it. The earth in its devotion
      carries all things, goodand evil,, without exception. In the
      same way the superior man gives to hischaracter breadth,
      purity, and sustaining power, so that he is able both
      tosupport and to bear with people and things.

  <div class="lines">
    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>When there is hoarfrost underfoot, Solid ice is not far
      off. Just as the light-giving power represents life, so the
      dark power, theshadowy, represents death. When the first
      hoarfrost comes in the autumn, thepower of darkness and cold
      is just at its beginning. After these firstwarnings, signs of
      death will gradually multiply, until, in obedience
      toimmutable laws, stark winter with its ice is here. In life
      it is the same.After certain scarcely noticeable signs of
      decay have appeared, they go onincreasing until final
      dissolution comes. But in life precautions can be takenby
      heeding the first signs of decay and checking them in
      time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Six in the second place means:
      <p>Straight, square, great. Without purpose, Yet nothing
      remains unfurthered. The symbol of heaven is the circle, and
      that of earth is the square. Thussquareness is a primary
      quality of the earth. On the other hand, movement in
      astraight line, as well as magnitude, is a primary quality of
      the Creative. Butall square things have their origin in a
      straight line and into turn formsolid bodies. In mathematics,
      when we discriminate between lines, planes andsolids, we find
      that rectangular planes result from straight lines, and
      cubicmagnitudes from rectangular planes. The Receptive
      accommodates itself to thequalities of the Creative and makes
      them its own. Thus a square develops outof a straight line
      and a cube out of a square. This is compliance with thelaws
      of the Creative; nothing is taken away, nothing added.
      Therefore theReceptive has no need of a special purpose of
      its own, nor of any effort' yeteverything turns out as it
      should. Nature creates all beings without erring:this is its
      foursquareness. It tolerates all creatures equally: this is
      itsgreatness. Therefore it attains what is right for all
      without artifice orspecial intentions. Man achieves the
      height of wisdom when all that he does isas self-evident as
      what nature does.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>Hidden lines. One is able to remain persevering. If by
      chance you are in the service of a king, Seek not works, but
      bring to completion. If a man is free of vanity he is able to
      conceal his abilities and keep themfrom attracting attention
      too soon; thus he can mature undisturbed. Ifconditions demand
      it, he can also enter public life, but that too he does
      withrestraint. The wise man gladly leaves fame to others. He
      does not seek to havecredited to himself things that stand
      accomplished, but hopes to releaseactive forces; that is, he
      completes his works in such a manner that they maybear fruit
      for the future.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Six in the fourth place means:
      <p>A tied-up sack. No blame, no praise.</p>
      <p>The dark element opens when it moves and closes when at
      rest. The strictestreticence is indicated here. The time is
      dangerous , because any degree ofprominence leads either to
      the enmity of irresistible antagonists if onechallenges them
      or to misconceived recognition if one is
      complaisant.Therefore a man ought to maintain reserve, be it
      in solitude or in the turmoilof the world, for there too he
      can hide himself so well that no one knows him.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>A yellow lower garment brings supreme good fortune. Yellow
      is the color of the earth and of the middle; it is the symbol
      of thatwhich is reliable and genuine. The lower garment is
      inconspicuously decorated--the symbol of aristocratic
      reserve. When anyone is called upon to work in aprominent but
      not independent position, true success depends on the
      utmostdiscretion. A man's genuineness and refinement should
      not reveal themselvesdirectly; they should express themselves
      only indirectly as an effect fromwithin.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>Dragons fight in the meadow. Their blood is black and
      yellow.</p>
      <p>In the top place the dark element should yield to the
      light. If it attemptsto maintain a position to which it is
      not entitled and to rule instead ofserving, it draws down
      upon itself the anger of the strong. A struggle ensuesin
      which it is overthrown, with injury, however, to both sides.
      The dragon,symbol of heaven, comes to fight the false dragon
      that symbolized theinflation of the earth principle. Midnight
      blue is the color of heaven; yellowis the color of earth.
      Therefore, when black and yellow blood flow, it is asign that
      in this unnatural contest both primal powers suffer injury.
      When all the lines are sixes, it means: Lasting perseverance
      furthers. When nothing but sixes appears, the hexagram of THE
      RECEPTIVE changes intothe hexagram of THE CREATIVE. By
      holding fast to what is right, it gains thepower of enduring.
      There is indeed no advance, but neither is
      thereretrogression.</p>
