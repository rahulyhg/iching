18. Ku / Work on what has been spoiled [ Decay ]

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above Ken KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN  below Sun THE GENTLE, WIND

</div><div class="explanation">
 The Chinese character ku represents a bowl in whose contents worms arebreeding. This means decay. IT is come about because the gentle indifferencein the lower trigram has come together with the rigid inertia of the upper,and the result is stagnation. Since this implies guilt, the conditions embodya demand for removal of the cause. Hence the meaning of the hexagram is notsimply "what has been spoiled" but "work on what has been spoiled".

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN SPOILED  Has supreme success.  It furthers one to cross the great water.  Before the starting point, three days.  After the starting point, three days.

</div><div class="explanation">
 What has been spoiled through man's fault can be made good again throughman's work. IT is not immutable fate, as in the time of STANDSTILL, that hascaused the state of corruption, but rather the abuse of human freedom. Worktoward improving conditions promises well, because it accords thepossibilities of the time. We must not recoil from work and danger-symbolizedby crossing of the great water-but must take hold energetically. Successdepends, however, on proper deliberation. This is expressed by the lines,"Before the starting point, three days. After the starting point, three days."We must first know the cause of corruption before we can do away with them;hence it is necessary to be cautious during the time before the start. Then wemust see to it that the new way is safely entered upon, so that a relapse maybe avoided; therefore we must pay attention to the time after the start.Decisiveness and energy must take the place of inertia and indifference thathave led to decay, in order that the ending may be followed by a newbeginning.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 The wind blows low on the mountain:  The image of DECAY.  Thus the superior man stirs up the people  And strengthens their spirit.

</div><div class="explanation">
 When the wind blow s slow on the mountain, it is thrown back and spoils thevegetation. This contains a challenge to improvement. It is the same withdebasing attitudes and fashions; they corrupt human society. His methodslikewise must be derived from the two trigrams, but in such a way that theireffects unfold in orderly sequence. The superior must first remove stagnationby stirring up public opinion, as the wind stirs up everything, and muststrengthen and tranquilize the character of the people, as the mountain givestranquillity and nourishment to all that grows in its vicinity.
