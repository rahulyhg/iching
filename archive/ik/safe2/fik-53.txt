    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      This hexagram is made up of Sun (wood, penetration) above,
      i.e., without,and Ken (mountain, stillness) below, i.e.,
      within. A tree on a mountaindevelops slowly according to the
      law of its being and consequently standsfirmly rooted. This
      gives the idea of a development that proceeds gradually,step
      by step. The attributes of the trigrams also point to this:
      within istranquillity, which guards against precipitate
      actions, and without ispenetration, which makes development
      and progress possible.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      DEVELOPMENT. The maiden Is given in marriage. Good fortune.
      Perseverance furthers.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The development of events that leads to a girl's following a
      man to his homeproceeds slowly. The various formalities must
      be disposed of before themarriage takes place. This principle
      of gradual development can be applied toother situations as
      well; it is always applicable where it is a matter ofcorrect
      relationships of co-operation, as for instance in the
      appointment ofan official. The development must be allowed to
      take its proper course. Hastyaction would not be wise. This
      is also true, finally, of any effort to exertinfluence on
      others, for here too the essential factor is a correct way
      ofdevelopment through cultivation of one's own personality.
      No influence such asthat exerted by agitators has a lasting
      effect. Within the personality too,development must follow
      the same course if lasting results are to be
      achieved.Gentleness that is adaptable, but at the same time
      penetrating, is the outerform that should proceed from inner
      calm. The very gradualness of thedevelopment makes it
      necessary to have perseverance, for perseverance
      aloneprevents slow progress from dwindling to nothing.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      On the mountain, a tree: The image of DEVELOPMENT. Thus the
      superior man abides in dignity and virtue, In order to
      improve the mores.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The tree on the mountain is visible from afar, and its
      developmentinfluences the landscape of the entire region. It
      does not shoot up like aswamp plant; its growth proceeds
      gradually. Thus also the work of influencingpeople can be
      only gradual. No sudden influence or awakening is of
      lastingeffect. Progress must be quite gradual, and in order
      to obtain such progressin public opinion and in the mores of
      the people, it is necessary for thepersonality to acquire
      influence and weight. This comes about through carefuland
      constant work on one's own moral development.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>The wild goose gradually draws near the shore.</p>
      <p>The young son is in danger.</p>
      <p>There is talk. No blame.</p>
      <p>All the individual lines in this hexagram symbolize the
      gradual flight ofthe wild goose. The wild goose is the symbol
      of conjugal fidelity, because itis believed that this bird
      never takes another mate after the death of thefirst. The
      initial line suggests the first resting place in the flight
      ofwater birds from the water to the heights. The shore is
      reached. The situationis that of a lonely young man who is
      just starting out to make his way inlife. Since no one comes
      to help him, his first steps are slow and hesitant,and he is
      surrounded by danger. Naturally he is subjected to much
      criticism.But these very difficulties keep him from being too
      hasty, and his progress issuccessful.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Six in the second place means:
      <p>The wild goose gradually draws near the cliff. Eating and
      drinking in peace and concord. Good fortune.</p>
      <p>The cliff is a safe place on shore. The development has
      gone a step further.The initial insecurity has been overcome,
      and a safe position in life has beenfound, giving one enough
      to live on. This first success, opening up a path toactivity,
      brings a certain joyousness of mood, and one goes to meet the
      futurereassured. It is said of the wild goose that it calls
      to its comrades wheneverit finds food; this is the symbol of
      peace and concord in good fortune. A mandoes not want to keep
      his good luck for himself only, but is ready to share itwith
      others.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Nine in the third place means:
      <p>The wild goose gradually draws near the plateau.</p>
      <p>The man goes forth and does not return.</p>
      <p>The woman carries a child but does not bring it forth.
      Misfortune. It furthers one to fight off robbers.</p>
      <p>The high plateau is dry and unsuitable for the wild goose.
      If it goes there,it has lost its way and gone too far. This
      is contrary to the law ofdevelopment. It is the same in human
      life. If we do not let things developquietly but plunge of
      our own choice too rashly into a struggle, misfortuneresults.
      A man jeopardizes his own life, and his family perishes
      thereby.However, this is not all necessary; it is only the
      result of transgressing thelaw of natural development. If one
      does not willfully provoke a conflict, butconfines himself to
      vigorously maintaining his own position and to warding
      offunjustified attacks, all goes well.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Six in the fourth place means:
      <p>The wild goose goes gradually draws near the tree. Perhaps
      it will find a flat branch. No blame.</p>
      <p>A tree is not a suitable place for a wild goose. But if it
      is clever, itwill find a flat branch on which it can get a
      footing. A man's life too, inthe course of its development,
      often brings him into inappropriate situations,in which he
      finds it difficult to hold his own without danger. Then it
      isimportant to be sensible and yielding. This enables him to
      discover a safeplace in which life can go on, although he may
      be surrounded by danger.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>The wild goose gradually draws near the summit. For three
      years the woman has no child. In the end nothing can hinder
      her. Good fortune.</p>
      <p>The summit is a high place. In a high position one easily
      becomes isolated.One is misjudged by the very person on whom
      one is dependent-the woman by herhusband, the official by his
      superior. This is the work of deceitful personswho have
      wormed their way in. The result is that relationships remain
      sterile,and nothing is accomplished. But in the course of
      further development, suchmisunderstandings are cleared away,
      and reconciliation is achieved after all.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Nine at the top means:
      <p>The wild goose gradually draws near the clouds heights.
      Its feathers can be used for the sacred dance. Good
      fortune.</p>
      <p>Here life comes to its end. A man's work stands completed.
      The path riseshigh toward heaven, like the flight of wild
      geese when they have left theearth far behind. There they
      fly, keeping to the order of their flight instrict formation.
      And if their feathers fall, they can serve as ornaments inthe
      sacred dance pantomimes performed in the temples. Thus the
      life of a manwho has perfected himself is a bright light for
      the people of earth, who lookup to him as an example.</p>
