9. Hsiao Ch'u / The Taming Power of the Small

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above SUN THE GENTLE, WIND  below CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN

</div><div class="explanation">
 This hexagram means the force of the small--the power of the shadowy--thatrestrains, tames, impedes. A weak line in the fourth place, that of theminister, holds the five strong lines in check. In the Image it is the windblowing across the sky. The wind restrains the clouds, the rising breath ofthe Creative, and makes them grow dense, but as yet is not strong enough toturn them to rain. The hexagram presents a configuration of circumstances inwhich a strong element is temporarily held in leash by a weak element. It isonly through gentleness that this can have a successful outcome.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL  Has success.  Dense clouds, no rain from our western region.

</div><div class="explanation">
 This image refers to the state of affairs in China at the time when KingWen, who came originally from the west, was in the east at the court of thereigning tyrant Chou Hsin. The moment for action on a large scale had not yetarrived. King Wen could only keep the tyrant somewhat in check by friendlypersuasion. Hence the image of many clouds, promising moisture and blessing tothe land, although as yet no rain falls. The situation is not unfavorable;there is a prospect of ultimate success, but there are still obstacles in theway, and we can merely take preparatory measures. Only through the small meansof friendly persuasion can we exert any influence. The time has not yet comefor sweeping measures. However, we may be able, to a limited extent, to act asa restraining and subduing influence. To carry out our purpose we need firmdetermination within and gentleness and adaptability in external relations.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 The wind drives across heaven:  The image of THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL.Thus the superior man  Refines the outward aspect of his nature.

</div><div class="explanation">
 The wind can indeed drive the clouds together in the sky; yet, being nothingbut air, without solid body, it does not produce great or lasting effects. Soalso an individual, in times when he can produce no great effect in the outerworld, can do nothing except refine the expression of his nature in smallways.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Nine at the beginning means: <p>Return to the way.  How could there be blame in this?  Good fortune.<p> It lies in the nature of a strong man to press forward. In so doing heencounters obstructions. Therefore he returns to the way suited to hissituation, where he is free to advance or to retreat. In the nature of thingsthis will bring good fortune, for it is wise and reasonable not to try toobtain anything by force.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Nine in the second place means: <p>He allows himself to be drawn into returning.  Good fortune.<p> One would like to press forward, but before going farther one sees from theexample of others like oneself that this way is blocked. In such a case, ifthe effort to push forward is not in harmony with the time, a reasonable andresolute man will not expose himself to a personal rebuff, but will retreatwith others of like mind. This brings good fortune, because he does notneedlessly jeopardize himself.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>The spokes burst out of the wagon wheels.  Man and wife roll their eyes.  <p> Here an attempt is made to press forward forcibly, in the consciousness thatthe obstructing power is slight. But since, under the circumstances, poweractually lies with the weak, this sudden offensive is doomed to failure.External conditions hinder the advance, just as loss of the wheel spokes stopsthe progress of a wagon. We do not yet heed this hint form fate, hence thereare annoying arguments like those of a married couple. Naturally this is not afavorable state of thing, for though the situation may enable the weaker sideto hold its ground, the difficulties are too numerous to permit of a happyresult. In consequence even the strong man cannot so use his power as to exertthe right influence on those around him. He experiences a rebuff where heexpected an easy victory, and he thus compromises his dignity.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>If you are sincere, blood vanishes and fear gives way.  No blame.  <p> If one is in the difficult and responsible position of counselor to apowerful man, on should restrain him in such a way that the threat of actualbloodshed may arise. Nonetheless, the power of disinterested truth is greaterthan all theses obstacles. It carries such weight that the end is achieved,and all danger of bloodshed and all fear disappear.

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Nine in the fifth place means: <p>If you are sincere and loyally attached,  You are rich in your neighbor.<p> Loyalty leads to firm ties because it means that each partner complementsthe other. In the weaker person loyalty consists in devotion, in the strongerit consists in trustworthiness. This relation of mutual reinforcement leads toa true wealth that is all the more apparent because it is not selfishlyhoarded but is shared with friends. Pleasure shared is pleasure doubled.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Nine at the top means: <p>The rain comes, there is rest.  This is due to the lasting effect of character.  Perseverance brings the woman into danger.  The moon is nearly full.  If the superior man persists,  Misfortune comes.<p> Success is at hand. The wind has driven up the rain. A fixed standpoint hasbeen reach. This has come about through the cumulation of small effectsproduced by reverence for a superior character. But a success thus secured bitby bit calls for great caution. It would be a dangerous illusion for anyone tothink he could presume upon it. The female principle, the weak element thathas won the victory, should never persist in vaunting it--that would lead todanger. The dark power in the moon is strongest when the moon is almost full.When it is full and directly opposite the sun, its waning is inevitable. Undersuch circumstances one must be content with what has been achieved. To advanceany further, before the appropriate time has come, would lead to misfortune.
