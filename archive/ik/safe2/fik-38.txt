      This hexagram is composed of the trigram Li above, i.e.,
      flame, which burnsupward, and Tui below, i.e., the lake,
      which seeps downward. These twomovements are indirect
      contrast. Furthermore, LI is the second daughter andTui the
      youngest daughter, and although they live in the same house
      theybelong to different men; hence their wills are not the
      same but aredivergently directed.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      OPPOSITION. In small matters, good fortune.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      When people live in opposition and estrangement they cannot
      carry out agreat undertaking in common; their points of view
      diverge too widely. In suchcircumstances one should above all
      not proceed brusquely, for that would onlyincrease the
      existing opposition; instead, one should limit oneself
      toproducing gradual effects in small matters. Here success
      can still beexpected, because the situation is such that the
      opposition does not precludeall agreement. In general,
      opposition appears as an obstruction, but when itrepresents
      polarity within a comprehensive whole, it has also its useful
      andimportant functions. The oppositions of heaven and earth,
      spirit and nature,man and woman, when reconciled, bring about
      the creation and reproduction oflife. In the world of visible
      things, the principle of opposites makespossible the
      differentiation by categories through which order is brought
      intothe world.

      THE IMAGE.
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Above, fire; below. The lake. The image of OPPOSITION. Thus
      amid all fellowship
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The superior man retains his individuality.
      <p>The two elements, fire and water, never mingle but even
      when in contactretain their own natures. So the sutured man
      is never led into baseness orvulgarity through intercourse or
      community of interests with persons ofanother sort;
      regardless of all commingling, he will always preserve
      hisindividuality.</p>

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>Remorse disappears. If you lose your horse, do not run
      after it; It will come back of its own accord. When you see
      evil people, Guard yourself against mistakes.</p>
      <p>Even in times when oppositions prevail, mistakes can be
      avoided, so thatremorse disappears. When opposition begins to
      manifest itself, a man must nottry to bring about unity by
      force, for by so doing he would only achieve thecontrary,
      just as a horse goes farther and farther away if one runs
      after it.It it is one's won horse, one can safely let it go;
      it will come back of itsown accord. So too when someone who
      belongs with us is momentarily estrangedbecause of a
      misunderstanding, he will return of his own accord if we
      leavematters to him. One the other hand, it is well to be
      cautious when evil menwho do not belong with us force
      themselves upon us, again as the result of amisunderstanding.
      Here the important thing is to avoid mistakes. We must nottry
      to shake off these evil men by force; this would give rise to
      realhostility. We must simply endure them. They will
      eventually withdraw of theirown accord.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>One meets his lord in a narrow street.</p>
      <p>No blame.</p>
      <p>As a result of misunderstandings, it has become impossible
      for people who bynature belong together to meet in the
      correct way. This being so, anaccidental meeting under
      informal circumstances may serve the purpose,provided there
      is an inner affinity between them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>One sees the wagon dragged back,</p>
      <p>The oxen halted, A man's hair and nose cut off.</p>
      <p>Not a good beginning, but a good end.</p>
      <p>Often it seems tot a man as though everything were
      conspiring against him.He sees himself checked and hindered
      in his progress, insulted and dishonored.However, he must not
      let himself be misled; despite this opposition, he mustcleave
      to the man with whom he knows he belongs. Thus,
      notwithstanding the badbeginning, the matter will end
      well.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>Isolated through opposition, One meets a like-minded man
      With whom one can associate in good faith. Despite the
      danger, no blame.</p>
      <p>If a man finds himself in a company of people from whom he
      is separated byan inner opposition, he becomes isolated. But
      if in such a situation a manmeets someone who fundamentally
      by the very law of his being, is kin to him,and whom he can
      trust completely, he overcomes all the dangers of
      isolation.His will achieves its aim, and he becomes free of
      faults.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>Remorse disappears.</p>
      <p>The companion bits his way through the wrappings. If one
      goes to him, How could it be a mistake?</p>
      <p>Coming upon a sincere man, one fails to recognize him at
      first because ofthe general estrangement. However, he bites
      his way through the wrappings thatare causing the separation.
      When such a companion thus reveals himself in histrue
      character, it is one's duty to go to meet him and to work
      with him.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Nine at the top means:
      <p>Isolated through opposition, One sees one's companion as a
      pig covered with dirt, As a wagon full of devils. First one
      draws a bow against him,</p>
      <p>Then one lays the bow aside. He is not a robber; he will
      woo at the right time. As one goes, rain falls; then good
      fortune comes.</p>
      <p>Here the isolation is due to misunderstanding; it is
      brought about not byouter circumstances but by inner
      conditions. A man misjudges his best friends,taking them to
      be as unclean as a dirty pig in and as dangerous as a
      wagonfull of devils. He adopts an attitude of defense. But in
      the end, realizinghis mistake, he lays aside the bow,
      perceiving that the other is approachingwith the best
      intentions for the purpose of close union. Thus the tension
      isrelieved. The union resolves the tension, just as falling
      rain relieves thesultriness preceding a thunderstorm. All
      goes well, for just when oppositionreaches its climax it
      changes over to its antithesis.</p>
