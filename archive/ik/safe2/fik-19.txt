      19. Lin / Approach

      The Chinese word lin has a range of meanings that is not
      exhausted by anysingle word of another language. The ancient
      explanations in the Book ofChanges give as its first meaning,
      "becoming great." What becomes great arethe two strong lines
      growing into the hexagram from below; the light-givingpower
      expands with them. The meaning is then further extended to
      include theconcept of approach, especially the approach of
      what is lower. Finally themeaning includes the attitude of
      condescension of a man in high positiontoward the people, and
      in general the setting to work on affairs. Thishexagram is
      linked with the twelfth month (January-February), when after
      thewinter solstice, the light power begins to ascend again.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      APPROACH has supreme success. Perseverance furthers. When the
      eighth month comes, there will be misfortune.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The hexagram as a whole points to a time of joyous, hopeful
      progress. Springis approaching. Joy and forbearance bring
      high and low nearer together.Success is certain. But we must
      work with determination and perseverance tomake full use of
      the propitiousness of the time. And on thing more: springdoes
      not last forever. In the eighth month the aspects are
      reversed. Then onlytwo strong, light lines are left; these do
      not advance but are in retreat (seenext hexagram). We must
      take heed of this change in good time. If we meet evilbefore
      it becomes reality-before it has even begun to stir-we can
      master it.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      The earth above the lake: The image of APPROACH. Thus the
      superior man is inexhaustible In his will to teach, And
      without limits In his tolerance and protection of the people.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The earth borders upon the lake from above. This symbolizes
      the approach andcondescension of the man of higher position
      to those beneath him. The twoparts of the image indicate what
      his attitude toward these people will be.Just as the lake is
      inexhaustible in depth, so the sage is inexhaustible inhis
      readiness to teach mankind, and just as the earth is
      boundlessly wide,sustaining and caring for all creatures on
      it, so the sage sustains and caresfor all people and excludes
      no part of humanity.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>Joint approach. Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
      <p>The good begins to prevail and to find response in
      influential circles. Thisin turn is an incentive to men of
      ability. IT is well to join this upwardtrend, but we must not
      let ourselves be carried away by the current of thetime; we
      must adhere perseveringly to what is right. This bring good
      fortune.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>Joint approach. Good fortune. Everything furthers.</p>
      <p>When the stimulus to approach comes from a high place, and
      when a man hasthe inner strength and consistency that need no
      admonition, good fortune willensue. Nor need the future cause
      any concern. He is well aware that everythingearthly is
      transitory, and that a descent follows upon every rise, but
      neednot be confused by this universal law of fate. Everything
      serves to further.Therefore he will travel the paths of life
      swiftly, honestly, and valiantly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>Comfortable approach. Nothing that would further. If one
      is induced to grieve over it, One becomes free of blame.</p>
      <p>Things are going well for a man: he achieves power and
      influence. But inthis lies the danger that he may relax, and
      confident of his position, allowthe easygoing, careless mood
      to show itself in his dealings with other people.This would
      inevitably be harmful. But there is possibility of a change
      ofmood. If he regrets his mistaken attitude and feels the
      responsibility of aninfluential position, he frees himself of
      faults.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Six in the fourth place means:
      <p>Complete approach. No blame.</p>
      <p>While the three lower lines indicate rise to power and
      influence, the threeupper lines show the attitude of persons
      in higher position toward those oflower rank for whom they
      procure influence. Here is shown the open-mindedapproach of a
      person of high rank to a man of ability whom he draws in to
      hisown circle, regardless of class prejudice. This is very
      favorable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>Wise approach. This is right for a great prince. Good
      fortune.</p>
      <p>A prince, or anyone in a leading position, must have the
      wisdom to attractto himself people of ability who are expert
      in directing affairs. His wisdomconsists both in selecting
      the right people and in allowing those chosen tohave a free
      hand without interference from him. For only through such
      self-restraint will he find the experts needed to satisfy all
      of his requirements.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>Great hearted approach. Good-hearted approach. Good
      fortune. No blame.</p>
      <p>A sage who has put the world behind him and who in spirit
      has alreadywithdrawn from life may, under certain
      circumstances, decide to return oncemore to the here and now
      and to approach other men. This means great goodfortune for
      the men whom he teaches and helps. And for him this great
      heartedhumbling of himself is blameless.</p>
