      26. Ta Ch'u / The Taming Power of the Great
    </div>
    <div class="trigrams">
      above KeN KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN below CH'IEN THE CREATIVE,
      HEAVEN
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The Creative is tamed by Ken, Keeping Still. This produces
      great power, asituation in contrast to that of the ninth
      hexagram, Hsiao Ch'u, THE TAMINGPOWER OF THE SMALL, in which
      the Creative is tamed by the Gentle alone. Thereone weak line
      must tame five strong lines, but here four strong lines
      arerestrained by two weak lines; in addition to a minister,
      there is a prince,and the restraining power therefore is afar
      stronger. The hexagram has athreefold meaning, expressing
      different aspects of the concept "Holding firm."Heaven within
      the mountain gives the idea of holding firm in the sense
      ofholding together; the trigram Ken which holds the trigram
      ch'ien still, givesthe idea of holding firm in the sense of
      holding back; the third idea is thatof holding firm in the
      sense of caring for and nourishing. This last issuggested by
      the fact that a strong line at the top, which is the ruler of
      thehexagram, is honored and tended as a sage. The third of
      these meanings alsoattaches specifically to this strong line
      at the top, which represents thesage.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT. Perseverance furthers.
      <p>Not eating at home brings good fortune. It furthers one to
      cross the great water.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      To hold firmly to great creative powers and store them up, as
      set forth inthis hexagram, there is need of a strong,
      clear-headed man who is honored bythe ruler. The trigram
      Ch'ein points to strong creative power; Ken indicatesfirmness
      and truth. Both point to light and clarity and to the daily
      renewalof character. Only through such daily self-renewal can
      a man continue at theheight of his powers. Force of habit
      helps to keep order in quiet times; butin periods when there
      is a great storing up of energy, everything depends onthe
      power of the personality. However, since the worthy are
      honored, as in thecase of the strong personality entrusted
      with leadership by the ruler, it isan advantage not to eat at
      home but rather to earn one's bread by enteringupon public
      office. Such a man is in harmony with heaven; therefore even
      greatand difficult undertakings, such as crossing the great
      water, succeed.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Heaven within the mountain: The image of THE TAMING POWER OF
      THE GREAT. Thus the superior man acquaints himself with many
      sayings of antiquity And many deeds of the past, In order to
      strengthen his character thereby.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Heaven within the mountain points to hidden treasures. In the
      words anddeeds of the past there lies hidden a treasure that
      men may use to strengthenand elevate their own characters.
      The way to study the past is not to confineoneself to mere
      knowledge of history but, through application of
      thisknowledge, to give actuality to the past.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>Danger is at hand. It furthers one to desist.</p>
      <p>A man wishes to make vigorous advance, but circumstances
      present anobstacle. He sees himself held back firmly. If he
      should attempt to fore anadvance, it would lead him into
      misfortune. Therefore it is better for him tocompose himself
      and to wait until an outlet is offered for release of
      hisstored-up energies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>The axletrees are taken from the wagon.</p>
      <p>Here advance is checked just as in the third line of THE
      TAMING POWER OF THESMALL</p>
      <p>9. However, in the later the restraining force is slight;
      thus a conflictarises between the propulsive and the
      restraining movement, as a result ofwhich the spokes fall out
      of the wagon wheels, while here the restrainingforce is
      absolutely superior; hence no struggle takes place. One
      submits andremoves the axletrees from the wagon -in other
      words, contents himself withwaiting. In this way energy
      accumulates for a vigorous advance later on.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Nine in the third place means. A good horse that follows
      others. Awareness of danger, With perseverance, furthers.
      Practice chariot driving and armed defense daily. It furthers
      one to have somewhere to go.
      <p>The way opens; the hindrance has been cleared away. A man
      is in contact witha strong will acting in the same direction
      as his own, and goes forward likeone good horse following
      another. But danger still threatens, and he mustremain aware
      of it, or he will be robbed of his firmness. Thus he must
      acquireskill on the one hand in what will take him forward,
      and on the other in whatwill protect him against unforeseen
      attacks. It is good in such a pass to havea goal toward which
      to strive.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Six in the fourth place means:
      <p>The headboard of a young bull. Great good fortune.</p>
      <p>This line and the one following it are the two that tame
      the forward-pushinglower lines. Before a bull's horns grow
      out, a headboard is fastened to itsforehead, so that later
      when the horns appear they cannot do harm. A good wayto
      restrain wild force is to forestall it. By so doing one
      achieves an easyand great success.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>The tusk of a gelded boar. Good fortune.</p>
      <p>Here the restraining of the impetuous forward drive is
      achieved in anindirect way. A boar's tusk is in itself
      dangerous, but if the boar's natureis altered, the tusk is no
      longer a menace. Thus also where men are concerned,wild force
      should not be combated directly; instead, its roots should
      beeradicated.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Nine at the top means:
      <p>One attains the way of heaven.</p>
      <p>Success.</p>
      <p>The time of obstruction is past. The energy long dammed up
      by inhibitionforces its way out and achieves great success.
      This refers to a man who ishonored by the ruler and whose
      principles now prevail and shape the world.</p>
