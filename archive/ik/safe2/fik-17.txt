      The trigram Tui, the Joyous, whose attribute is gladness, is
      above; Chen,the Arousing, which has the attribute of
      movement, is below. Joy in movementinduces following. The
      Joyous is the youngest daughter, while the Arousing isthe
      eldest son. An older man defers to a young girl and shows
      herconsideration. By this he moves her to follow him.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      FOLLOWING has supreme success. Perseverance furthers. No
      blame.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      In order to obtain a following one must first know how to
      adapt oneself. Ifa man would rule he must first learn to
      serve, for only in this way does hesecure from those below
      him the joyous assent that is necessary if they are tofollow
      him. If he has to obtain a following by force or cunning, by
      conspiracyor by creating faction, he invariably arouses
      resistance, which obstructswilling adherence. But even joyous
      movement can lead to evil consequences,hence the added
      stipulation, "Perseverance furthers" --that is, consistency
      indoing right-- together with "No blame." Just as we should
      not ask others tofollow us unless this condition is
      fulfilled, so it is only under thiscondition that we can in
      turn follow others without coming to harm. Thethought of
      obtaining a following through adaptation to the demands of
      the timeis a great and significant idea; this is why the
      appended judgment is sofavorable.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Thunder in the middle of the lake: The image of FOLLOWING.
      Thus the superior man at nightfall Goes indoors for rest and
      recuperation.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      In the autumn electricity withdraws into the earth again and
      rests. Here itis the thunder in the middle of the lake that
      serves as the image--thunder inits winter rest, not thunder
      in motion. The idea of following in the sense ofadaptation to
      the demands of the time grows out of this image. Thunder in
      themiddle of the lake indicates times of darkness and rest.
      Similarly, a superiorman, after being tirelessly active all
      day, allows himself rest andrecuperation at night. No
      situation can become favorable until one is able toadapt to
      it and does not wear himself out with mistaken resistance.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>The standard is changing. Perseverance brings good
      fortune. To go out of the door in company Produces deeds.</p>
      <p>There are exceptional conditions in which the relation
      between leader andfollowers changes. It is implicit in the
      idea of following and adaptation thatif one wants to lead
      others, one must remain accessible and responsive to theviews
      of those under him. At the same time, however, he must have
      firmprinciples, so that he does not vacillate where there is
      only a question ofcurrent opinion. Once we are ready to
      listen to the opinions of others, wemust not associate
      exclusively with people who share our views or with membersof
      our own party; instead, we must go out and mingle freely with
      all sorts ofpeople, friends or foes. That is the only way to
      achieve something.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Six in the second place means:
      <p>If one clings to the little boy, One loses the strong
      man.</p>
      <p>In friendships and close relationships an individual must
      make a carefulchoice. He surrounds himself either with good
      or with bad company; he cannothave both at once. If he throws
      himself away on unworthy friends he losesconnection with
      people of intellectual power who could further him in
      thegood.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>If one clings to the strong man, One loses the little
      boy.</p>
      <p>Through following one finds what one seeks. It furthers
      one to remain persevering.</p>
      <p>When the right connection with distinguished people has
      been found, acertain loss naturally ensues. A man must part
      company with the inferior andsuperficial. But in his heart he
      will feel satisfied, because he seeks andneeds for the
      development of his personality. The important thing is to
      remainfirm. He must know what he wants and not be led astray
      by momentaryinclinations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>Following creates success. Perseverance brings misfortune.
      To go one's way with sincerity brings clarity. How could
      there be blame in this?</p>
      <p>It often happens, when a man exerts a certain amount of
      influence, that heobtains a following by condescension toward
      inferiors. But the people whoattach themselves to him are not
      honest in their intentions. They seekpersonal advantage and
      try to make themselves indispensable through flatteryand
      subservience. If one becomes accustomed to such satellites
      and cannot dowithout them, it brings misfortune. Only when a
      man is completely free fromhis ego, and intent, by
      conviction, upon what is right and essential, does heacquire
      the clarity that enables him to see through such people, and
      becomefree of blame.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>Sincere in the good. Good fortune.</p>
      <p>Every man must have something he follows--something that
      serves him as alodestar. He who follows with conviction the
      beautiful and the good may feelhimself strengthened by this
      saying.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>He meets with firm allegiance And is still further bound.
      The king introduces him To the Western Mountain.</p>
      <p>This refers to a man, an exalted sage, who has already put
      the turmoil ofthe world behind him. But a follower appears
      who understands him and is not tobe put off. So the sage
      comes back into the world and aids the other in hiswork. Thus
      there develops an eternal tie between the two. The allegory
      ischosen from the annals of the Chou dynasty. The rulers of
      this dynasty honoredmen who had served them well by awarding
      them a place in the royal family'stemple of ancestors on the
      Western Mountain. In this way they were regarded assharing in
      the destiny of the ruling family.</p>
