      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      PROGRESS. The powerful prince Is honored with horses in large
      numbers. In a single day he is granted audience three times.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      As an example of progress, this pictures a time when a
      powerful feudal lordrallies the other lords around the
      sovereign and pledges fealty and peace. Thesovereign rewards
      him richly and invites him to a closer intimacy.
      <p>A twofold idea is set forth here. The actual effect of the
      progress emanatesfrom a man who is in a dependent position
      and whom the others regard as theirequal and are therefore
      willing to follow. This leader has enough clarity ofvision
      not to abuse his great influence but to use it rather for the
      benefitof his ruler. His ruler in turn is free of all
      jealousy, showers presents onthe great man, and invites him
      continually to his court. An enlightened rulerand an obedient
      servant--this is the condition on which great
      progressdepends.</p>

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      The sun rises over the earth: The image of PROGRESS. Thus the
      superior man himself Brightens his bright virtue.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The light of the sun rises over the earth is by nature clear.
      The higher thesun rises, the more it emerges from the dark
      mists, spreading the pristinepurity of its rays over an ever
      widening area. The real nature of man islikewise originally
      good, but it becomes clouded by contact with earthlythings
      and therefore needs purification before it can shine forth in
      itsnative clarity.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>Progressing, but turned back. Perseverance brings good
      fortune. If one meets with no confidence, one should remain
      calm.</p>
      <p>No mistake.</p>
      <p>At a time when all elements are pressing for progress, we
      are stilluncertain whether in the course of advance we may
      not meet with a rebuff. Thenthe thing to do is simply
      continue in what is right; in the end this willbring good
      fortune. It may be that we meet with no confidence. In this
      case weought not to try to win confidence regardless of the
      situation, but shouldremain calm and cheerful and refuse to
      be roused to anger. Thus we remain freeof mistakes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Six in the second place means:
      <p>Progressing, but in sorrow. Perseverance brings good
      fortune.</p>
      <p>Then one obtains great happiness from one's
      ancestress.</p>
      <p>Progress is halted; an individual is kept from getting in
      touch with the manin authority with whom he has a connection.
      When this happens, he must remainpersevering, although he is
      grieved; then with a maternal gentleness the manin question
      will bestow great happiness upon him. This happiness comes to
      him-and is well deserved-because in this case mutual
      attraction does not rest onselfish or partisan motives but on
      firm and correct principles.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>All are in accord. Remorse disappears.</p>
      <p>A man strives onward, in association with others whose
      backing encourageshim. This dispels any cause for regret over
      the fact that he does not haveenough independence to triumph
      unaided over every hostile turn of fate.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>Progress like a hamster. Perseverance brings danger.</p>
      <p>In times of progress it is easy for strong men in the
      wrong places to amassgreat possessions. But such conduct
      shuns the light. And since times ofprogress are inevitably
      brought to the light, perseverance in such actionalways leads
      to danger.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>Remorse disappears.</p>
      <p>Take not gain and loss to heart. Undertakings bring good
      fortune. Everything serves to further.</p>
      <p>The situation described here is that of one who, finding
      himself in aninfluential position in a time of progress,
      remains gentle and reserved. Hemight reproach himself for
      lack of energy in making the most of thepropitiousness of the
      time and obtaining all possible advantage. However,
      thisregret passes away. He must not take either loss or gain
      to heart; they areminor considerations. What matters much
      more is the fact that in this way hehas assured himself of
      opportunities for successful and beneficent influence.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Nine at the top means:
      <p>Making progress with the horns is permissible Only for the
      purpose of punishing one's own city.</p>
      <p>To be conscious of danger brings good fortune. No blame.
      Perseverance brings humiliation.</p>
      <p>Making progress with lowered horns-i.e., acting on the
      offensive-ispermissible, in times like those referred to
      here, only in dealing with themistakes of one's own people.
      Even then we must bear in mind that proceedingon the
      offensive may always be dangerous. In this way we avoid the
      mistakesthat otherwise threaten, and succeed in what we set
      out to do. On the otherhand, perseverance in such over
      energetic behavior, especially toward personswith whom there
      is no close connection, will lead to humiliation.</p>
