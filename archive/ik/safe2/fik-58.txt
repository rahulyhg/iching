      58. Tui / The Joyous, Lake

      This hexagram, like sun, is one of the eight formed by
      doubling of atrigram. The trigram Tui denotes the youngest
      daughter; it is symbolized bythe smiling lake, and its
      attribute is joyousness. Contrary to appearances, itis not
      the yielding quality of the top line that accounts for joy
      here. Theattribute of the yielding or dark principle is not
      joy but melancholy.However, joy is indicated by the fact that
      there are two strong lines within,expressing themselves
      through the medium of gentleness. True joy, therefore,rests
      on firmness and strength within, manifesting itself outwardly
      asyielding and gentle.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      THE JOYOUS. Success. Perseverance is favorable.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The joyous mood is infectious and therefore brings success.
      But joy must bebased on steadfastness if it is not to
      degenerate into uncontrolled mirth.Truth and strength must
      dwell in the heart, while gentleness reveals itself insocial
      intercourse. In this way one assumes the right attitude
      toward God andman and achieves something. Under certain
      conditions, intimidation withoutgentleness may achieve
      something momentarily, but not for all time. When, onthe
      other hand, the hearts of men are won by friendliness, they
      are led totake all hardships upon themselves willingly, and
      if need be will not shundeath itself, so great is the power
      of joy over men.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Lakes resting one on the other: The image of THE JOYOUS. Thus
      the superior man joins with his friends For discussion and
      practice.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      A lake evaporates upward and thus gradually dries up; but
      when two lakes arejoined they do not dry up so readily, for
      one replenishes the other. It is thesame in the field of
      knowledge. Knowledge should be a refreshing andvitalizing
      force. It becomes so only through stimulating intercourse
      withcongenial friends with whom one holds discussion and
      practices application ofthe truths of life. In this way
      learning becomes many-sided and takes on acheerful lightness,
      whereas there is always something ponderous and
      one-sidedabout the learning of the self-taught.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>Contented joyousness. Good fortune.</p>
      <p>A quiet, wordless, self-contained joy, desiring nothing
      from without andresting content with everything, remains free
      of all egotistic likes anddislikes. In this freedom lies good
      fortune, because it harbors the quietsecurity of a heart
      fortified within itself.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>Sincere joyousness. Good fortune. Remorse disappears.</p>
      <p>We often find ourselves associating with inferior people
      in whose company weare tempted by pleasures that are
      inappropriate for the superior man. Toparticipate in such
      pleasures would certainly bring remorse, for a superiorman
      can find no real satisfaction in low pleasures. When,
      recognizing this, aman does not permit his will to swerve, so
      that he does not find such waysagreeable, not even dubious
      companions will venture to proffer any basepleasures, because
      he would not enjoy them. Thus every cause for regret
      isremoved.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>Coming joyousness. Misfortune.</p>
      <p>True joy must spring from within. But if one is empty
      within and whollygiven over to the world, idle pleasures come
      streaming in from without. Thisis what many people welcome as
      diversion. Those who lack inner stability andtherefore need
      amusement, will always find opportunity of indulgence.
      Theyattract external pleasures by the emptiness of their
      natures. Thus they losethemselves more and more, which of
      course has bad results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>Joyousness that is weighed is not at peace. After ridding
      himself of mistakes a man has joy.</p>
      <p>Often a man finds himself weighing the choice between
      various kinds ofpleasures, and so long as he has not decided
      which kind he will choose, thehigher or the lower, he has no
      inner peace. Only when he clearly recognizesthat passion
      brings suffering, can he make up his mind to turn away from
      thelower pleasures and to strive for the higher. Once this
      decision is sealed, hefinds true joy and peace, and inner
      conflict is overcome.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>Sincerity toward disintegrating influences is
      dangerous.</p>
      <p>Dangerous elements approach even the far best of men. If a
      man permitshimself to have anything to do with them, their
      disintegrating influence actsslowly but surely, and
      inevitable brings dangers in its train. But if herecognizes
      the situation and can comprehend the danger, he knows how
      toprotect himself and remains unharmed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>Seductive joyousness.</p>
      <p>A vain nature invites diverting pleasures and must suffer
      accordingly (cf.the six in the third place). If a man is
      unstable within, the pleasures of theworld that he does not
      shun have so powerful an influence that he is sweptalong by
      them. Here it is no longer a question of danger, of good
      fortune ormisfortune. He has given up direction of his own
      life, and what becomes of himdepends upon chance and external
      influences.</p>
