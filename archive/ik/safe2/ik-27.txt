 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH.  Perseverance brings good fortune.  Pay heed to the providing of nourishment  And to what a man seeks

</div><div class="explanation">
 To fill his own mouth with.<p> In bestowing care and nourishment, it is important that the right peopleshould be taken care of and that we should attend to our own nourishment inthe right way. If we wish to know what anyone is like, we have only to observeon whom he bestows his care and what sides of his own nature he cultivates andnourishes. Nature nourishes all creatures. The great man fosters and takescare of superior men, in order to take care of all men through them. Menciussays about this: <p> If we wish to know whether anyone is superior or not, we need only observewhat part of his being he regards as especially important. The body hassuperior and inferior, important and unimportant parts. We must not injureimportant parts for the sake of the unimportant, nor must we injure thesuperior parts for the sake of the inferior. He who cultivates the inferiorparts of his nature is an inferior man. He who cultivates the superior partsof his nature is a superior man.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 At the foot of the mountain, thunder:  The image of PROVIDING NOURISHMENT. Thus the superior man is careful of his words  And temperate in eating and drinking.

</div><div class="explanation">
 "God comes forth in the sign of the Arousing": when in the spring the lifeforces stir again, all things comes into being anew. "He brings to perfectionin the sign of Keeping Still": thus in the early spring, when the seeds fallto earth, all things are made ready. This is an image of providing nourishmentthrough movement and tranquillity. The superior man takes it as a pattern forthe nourishment and cultivation of his character. Words are a movement goingform within outward. Eating and drinking are movements from without inward.Both kinds of movement can be modified by tranquillity. For tranquillity keepsthe words that come out of the mouth from exceeding proper measure, and keepsthe food that goes into the mouth from exceeding its proper measure. Thuscharacter is cultivated.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Nine at the beginning means: <p>You let your magic tortoise go,  And look at me with the corners of your mouth drooping.  Misfortune.<p> The magic tortoise is a creature possessed of such supernatural powers thatit lives on air and needs no earthly nourishment. The image means that a manfitted by nature and position to live freely and independently renounces thisself-reliance and instead looks with envy and discontent at others who areoutwardly in better circumstances. But such base envy only arouses derisionand contempt in those others. This has bad results.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>Turning to the summit for nourishment,  Deviating from the path<p> To seek nourishment from the hill.  Continuing to do this brings misfortune.<p> Normally a person either provides his own means of nourishment or issupported in a proper way by those whose duty of privilege it is to providefor him. If, owing to weakness of spirit, a man cannot support himself, afeeling of uneasiness comes over him; this is because in shirking the properway of obtaining a living, he accepts support as a favor from those in higherplace. This is unworthy, for he is deviating from his true nature. Kept upindefinitely, this course leads to misfortune.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Six in the third place means: <p>Turning away from nourishment.  Perseverance brings misfortune.  Do not act thus for ten years.<p> Nothing serves to further.  <p> He who seeks nourishment that does not nourish reels from desire togratification and in gratification craves desire. Mad pursuit of pleasure forthe satisfaction of the senses never brings one to the goal. One should never(ten years is a complete cycle of time) follow this path, for nothing good cancome of it.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>Turning to the summit  For provision of nourishment  Brings good fortune.<p> Spying about with sharp eyes  Like a tiger with insatiable craving.<p> No blame.<p> In contrast to the six in the second place, which refers to a man bentexclusively on his own advantage, this line refers to one occupying a highposition and striving to let his light sine forth. To do this he needshelpers, because he cannot attain his lofty aim alone. With the greed of ahungry tiger he is on the lookout for the right people. Since he is notworking for himself but for the good of all, there is no wrong in such zeal.  

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Six in the fifth place means: <p>Turning away from the path.<p> To remain persevering brings good fortune.  One should not cross the great water.<p> A man may be conscious of a deficiency in himself. He should be undertakingthe nourishment of the people, but he has not the strength to do it. Thus hemust turn from his accustomed path and beg counsel and help from a man who isspiritually his superior but undistinguished outwardly. If he maintains thisattitude of mind perseveringly, success and good fortune are his. But he mustremain aware of his dependence. He must not put his own person forward norattempt great labors, such as crossing the great water.  

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Nine at the top means: <p>The source of nourishment.  Awareness of danger brings good fortune.  It furthers one to cross the great water.<p> This describes a sage of the highest order, from whom emanate all influencesthat provide nourishment for others. Such a position brings with it heavyresponsibility. If he remains conscious of this fact, he has good fortune andmay confidently undertake even great and difficult labors, such as crossingthe great water. These undertakings bring general happiness for him and forall others.
