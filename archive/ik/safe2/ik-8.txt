8. Pi / Holding Together [union]

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above K'AN THE ABYSMAL, WATER  below K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH

</div><div class="explanation">
 The waters on the surface of the earth flow together wherever they can, asfor example in the ocean, where all the rivers come together. Symbolicallythis connotes holding together and the laws that regulate it. The same idea issuggested by the fact that all the lines of the hexagram except the fifth, theplace of the ruler, are yielding. The yielding lines hold together becausethey are influenced by a man of strong will in the leading position, a man whois their center of union. Moreover, this strong and guiding personality inturn holds together with the others, finding in them the complement of his ownnature.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 HOLDING TOGETHER brings good fortune.  Inquire of the oracle once again  Whether you possess sublimity, constancy, and perseverance;  Then there is no blame.<p> Those who are uncertain gradually join.  Whoever come too late  Meets with misfortune.

</div><div class="explanation">
 What is required is that we unite with others, in order that all maycomplement and aid one another through holding together. But such holdingtogether calls for a central figure around whom other persons may unite. Tobecome a center of influence holding people together is a grave matter andfraught with great responsibility. It requires greatness of spirit,consistency, and strength. Therefore let him who wishes to gather others abouthim ask himself whether he is equal to the undertaking, for anyone attemptingthe task without a real calling for it only makes confusion worse than if nounion at all had taken place. But when there is a real rallying point, thosewho at first are hesitant or uncertain gradually come in of their own accord.Late-comers must suffer the consequences, for in holding together the questionof the right time is also important. Relationships are formed and firmlyestablished according to definite inner laws. Common experiences strengthenthese ties, and he who comes too late to share in these basic experiences mustsuffer for it if, as a straggler, he finds the door locked. If a man hasrecognized the necessity for union and does not feel strong enough to functionas the center, it is his duty to become a member of some other organicfellowship.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 On the earth is water:  The image of HOLDING TOGETHER. Thus the kings of antiquity  Bestowed the different states as fiefs  And cultivated friendly relations  With the feudal lords.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Water fills up all the empty places on the earth and clings fast to it. Thesocial organization of ancient China was based on this principle of theholding together of dependents and rulers. Water flows to unite with water,because all parts of it are subject to the same laws. So too should humansociety hold together through a community of interests that allows eachindividual to feel himself a member of a whole. The central power of a socialorganization must see to it that every member finds that his true interestlies in holding together with it, as was the case in the paternal relationshipbetween king and vassals in ancient China.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>Hold to him in truth and loyalty;  This is without blame.  Truth, like a full earthen bowl"  Thus in the end  Good fortune comes from without.<p> Fundamental sincerity is the only proper basis for forming relationships.This attitude, symbolized by a full earthen bowl, in which the content iseverything and the empty form nothing, shows itself not in clever words butthrough the strength of what lies within the speaker. This strength is sogreat that it has power to attract good fortune to itself from without.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>Hold to him inwardly.  Perseverance brings good fortune.  <p> If a person responds perseveringly and in the right way to the behests fromabove that summon him to action, his relations with others are intrinsic andhe does not lose himself. But if a man seeks association with others as if hewere an obsequious office hunter, he throws himself away. He does not followthe path of the superior man, who never loses his dignity.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Six in the third place means: <p>You hold together with the wrong people.<p> We are often among people who do not belong to our own sphere. In that casewe must beware of being drawn into false intimacy through force of habit.Needless to say, this would have evil consequences. Maintaining sociabilitywithout intimacy is the only right attitude toward people, because otherwisewe should not be free to enter into relationship with people of our own kindlater on.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>Hold to him outwardly also.  Perseverance brings good fortune.<p> Here the relations with a man who is the center of union are wellestablished. Then we may, and indeed we should, show our attachment openly.But we must remain constant and not allow ourselves to be led astray.  

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Nine in the fifth place means: <p>Manifestation of holding together.  In the hunt the king uses beaters on three sides only  And forgoes game that runs off in front.  The citizens need no warning.  Good fortune.  <p> In the royal hunts of ancient China it was customary to drive up the gamefrom three sides, but on the fourth the animals had a chance to run off. Ifthey failed to do this they had to pass through a gate behind which the kingstood ready to shoot. Only animals that entered here were shot; those that ranoff in front were permitted to escape. This custom accorded with a kinglyattitude; the royal hunter did not wish to turn the chase into a slaughter,but held that the kill should consist only of those animals which had so tospeak voluntarily exposed themselves. There is depicted here a ruler, orinfluential man, to whom people are attracted. Those who come to him heaccepts, those who do not come are allowed to go their own way. He invitednone, flatters none--all come of their own free will. In this way theredevelops a voluntary dependence among those who hold him. They do not have tobe constantly on their guard but may express their opinions openly. Policemeasures are not necessary, and they cleave to their ruler of their ownvolition. The same principle of freedom is valid for life in general. Weshould not woo favor from people. If a man cultivates within himself thepurity and the strength that are necessary for one who is the center of afellowship, those who are meant for him come of their own accord.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Six at the top means: <p>He finds no head for holding together.  Misfortune.  <p> The head is the beginning. If the beginning is not right, there is no hopeof a right ending. If we have missed the right moment for union and go onhesitating to give complete and full devotion, we shall regret the error whenit is too late.
