      The hexagram Chen represents the eldest son, who seizes rule
      with energy andpower. A yang line develops below two yin
      lines and presses upward forcibly.This movement is so violent
      that it arouses terror. It is symbolized bythunder, which
      bursts forth from the earth and by its shock causes fear
      andtrembling.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      SHOCK brings success.
      <p>Shock comes-oh, oh! Laughing words -ha, ha!</p>
      <p>The shock terrifies for a hundred miles, And he does not
      let fall the sacrificial spoon and chalice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The shock that comes from the manifestation of God within the
      depths of theearth makes man afraid, but this fear of God is
      good, for joy and merrimentcan follow upon it. When a man has
      learned within his heart what fear andtrembling mean, he is
      safeguarded against any terror produced by outsideinfluences.
      Let the thunder roll and spread terror a hundred miles
      around: heremains so composed and reverent in spirit that the
      sacrificial rite is notinterrupted. This is the spirit that
      must animate leaders and rulers of men-aprofound inner
      seriousness from which all terrors glance off harmlessly.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Thunder repeated: the image of SHOCK. Thus in fear and
      trembling The superior man sets his life in order And
      examines himself.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The shock of continuing thunder brings fear and trembling.
      The superior manis always filled with reverence at the
      manifestation of God; he sets his lifein order and searches
      his heart, lest it harbor any secret opposition to thewill of
      God. Thus reverence is the foundation of true culture.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>Shock comes-oh, oh!</p>
      <p>Then follow laughing words-ha, ha! Good fortune.</p>
      <p>The fear and trembling engendered by shock come to an
      individual at first insuch a way that he sees himself placed
      at a disadvantage as against others.But this is only
      transitory. When the ordeal is over, he experiences
      relief,and thus the very terror he had to endure at the
      outset brings good fortune inthe long run.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Six in the second place means:
      <p>Shock comes bringing danger. A hundred thousand times You
      lose your treasures And must climb the nine hills. Do not go
      in pursuit of them. After seven days you will get them back
      again.</p>
      <p>This pictures a situation in which a shock endangers a man
      and he suffersgreat losses. Resistance would be contrary to
      the movement of the time and forthis reason unsuccessful.
      Therefore he must simply retreat to heightsinaccessible to
      the threatening forces of danger. He must accept his loss
      ofproperty without worrying too much about it. When the time
      of shock andupheaval that has robbed him of his possessions
      has passed, he will get themback again without going in
      pursuit of them.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>Shock comes and makes one distraught. If shock spurs to
      action One remains free of misfortune.</p>
      <p>There are three kinds of shock-the shock of heaven, which
      is thunder, theshock of fate, and, finally, the shock of the
      heart. The present hexagramrefers less to inner shock than to
      the shock of fate. In such times of shock,presence of mind is
      all too easily lost: the individual overlooks
      allopportunities for action and mutely lets fate take its
      course. But if heallows the shocks of fate to induce movement
      within his mind, he will overcomethese external blows with
      little effort.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>Shock is mired.</p>
      <p>Movement within the mind depends for its success partly on
      circumstances. Ifthere is neither a resistance that might be
      vigorously combated, nor yet ayielding that permits of
      victory-if, instead, everything is tough and inertlike
      mire-movement is crippled.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>Shock goes hither and thither. Danger. However, nothing at
      all is lost. Yet there are things to be done.</p>
      <p>This is a case not of a single shock but of repeated
      shocks with nobreathing space between. Nonetheless, the shock
      causes no loss, because onetakes care to stay in the center
      of movement and in this way to be spared thefate of being
      helplessly tossed hither and thither.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>Shock brings ruin and terrified gazing around. Going ahead
      brings misfortune. If it has not yet touched one's own body
      But has reached one's neighbor first,</p>
      <p>There is no blame. One's comrades have something to talk
      about.</p>
      <p>When inner shock is at its height, it robs a man of
      reflection and clarityof vision. In such a state of shock it
      is of course impossible to act withpresence of mind. Then the
      right thing is to keep still until composure andclarity are
      restored. But this a man can do only when he himself is not
      yetinfected by the agitation, although its disastrous effects
      are already visiblein those around him. If he withdraws from
      the affair in time, he remains freeof mistakes and injury.
      But his comrades, who no longer heed any warning, willin
      their excitement certainly be displeased with him. However,
      he must nottake this into account.</p>
