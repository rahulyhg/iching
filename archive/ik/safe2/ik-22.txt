</div><div class="trigrams">
 above KeN KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN  below LI THE CLINGING, FIRE

</div><div class="explanation">
 This hexagram shows a fire that breaks out of the secret depths of the earthand, blazing up, illuminates and beautifies the mountain, the heavenlyheights. Grace-beauty of form-is necessary in any union if it is to be wellordered and pleasing rather than disordered and chaotic.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 GRACE has success.  In small matters  It is favorable to undertake something.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Grace brings success. However, it is not the essential or fundamental thing;it is only the ornament and therefore be used sparingly and only in littlethings. In the lower trigram of fire a yielding line comes between two stronglines and makes them beautiful, but the strong lines are the essential contentand the weak line is the beautifying form. In the upper trigram of themountain, the strong line takes the lead, so that here again the strongelement must be regarded as the decisive factor. In nature we see in the skythe strong light of the sun; the life of the world depends on it. But thisstrong, essential thing is changed and given pleasing variety by the moon andthe stars. In human affairs, aesthetic form comes into being when traditionsexist that, strong and abiding like mountains, are made pleasing by a lucidbeauty. By contemplating the forms existing in the heavens we come tounderstand time and its changing demands. Through contemplation of the formsexisting in human society it becomes possible to shape the world.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Fire at the foot of the mountain: The image of GRACE.  Thus does the superior man proceed  When clearing up current affairs.  But he dare not decide controversial issues in this way.

</div><div class="explanation">
 The fire, whose light illuminates the mountain and makes it pleasing, doesnot shine far; in the same way, beautiful form suffices to brighten and tothrow light upon matters of lesser moment, but important questions cannot bedecided in this way. They require greater earnestness.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Nine at the beginning means: <p>He lends grace to his toes, leaves the carriage, and walks.<p> A beginner in subordinate place must take upon himself the labor ofadvancing.  There might be an opportunity of surreptitiously easing the way-symbolized by the carriage-but a self-contained man scorns help gained in adubious fashion.  He thinks it more graceful to go on foot than to drive in acarriage under false pretenses.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>Lends grace to the beard on his chin.<p> The beard is not an independent thing; it moves only with the chin. Theimage therefore means that form is to be considered only as a result andattribute of content. The beard is a superfluous ornament. To devote care toit for its own sake, without regard for the inner content of which it is anornament, would bespeak a certain vanity.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>Graceful and moist.  Constant perseverance brings good fortune.<p> This represents a very charming life situation. One is under the spell ofgrace and the mellow mood induced by wine. This grace can adorn, but it canalso swamp us. Hence the warning not to sink into convivial indolence but toremain constant in perseverance. Good fortune depends on this.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>Grace or simplicity?  A white horse comes as if on wings.  He is not a robber,  He will woo at the right time.<p> An individual is in a situation in which doubts arise as to which is better-to pursue the grace of external brilliance, or to return to simplicity. Thedoubt itself implies the answer. Confirmation comes from the outside; it comeslike a white winged horse. The white color indicates simplicity. At first itmay be disappointing to renounce the comforts that might have been obtained,yet one finds peace of mind in a true relationship with the friend who courtshim. The winged horse is the symbol of the thoughts that transcend all limitsof space and time.

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Six in the fifth place means: <p>Grace in the hills and gardens.  The roll of silk is meager and small.  Humiliation, but in the end good fortune.<p> A man withdraws from contact with people of the lowlands, who seek nothingbut magnificence and luxury, in to the solitude of the heights. There he findsan individual to look up to, whom he would like to have as a friend. But thegifts he has to offer are poor and few, so that he feels ashamed. However, itis not the material gifts that count, but sincerity of feeling, and so allgoes well in the end. 

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Nine at the top means: <p>Simple grace. No blame.<p> Here at the highest stage of development all ornament is discarded. Form nolonger conceals content but brings out its value to the full. Perfect graceconsists not in exterior ornamentation of the substance, but in the simplefitness of its form.
