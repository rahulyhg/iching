      Here the movement goes out of the sphere of danger. The
      obstacle has beenremoved, the difficulties are being
      resolved. Deliverance is not yet achieved;it is just in its
      beginning, and the hexagram represents its various stages.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      DELIVERANCE. The southwest furthers. If there is no longer
      anything where one has to go, Return brings good fortune. If
      there is still something where one has to go, Hastening
      brings good fortune.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      This refers to a time in which tensions and complications
      begin to be eased.At such times we ought to make our way back
      to ordinary conditions as soon aspossible; this is the
      meaning of "the southwest." These periods of suddenchange
      have great importance. Just as rain relieves atmospheric
      tension,making all the buds burst open, so a time of
      deliverance from burdensomepressure has a liberating and
      stimulating effect on life. One thing isimportant, however:
      in such times we must not overdo our triumph. The point isnot
      to push on farther than is necessary. Returning to the
      regular order oflife as soon as deliverance is achieved
      brings good fortune. If there are anyresidual matters that
      ought to be attended to, it should be done as quickly
      aspossible, so that a clean sweep is made and no retardations
      occur.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Thunder and rain set in: The image of DELIVERANCE. Thus the
      superior man pardons mistakes And forgives misdeeds.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      A thunderstorm has the effect of clearing the air; the
      superior man producesa similar effect when dealing with
      mistakes and sins of men that induce acondition of tension.
      Through clarity he brings deliverance. However, whenfailings
      come to light, he does not dwell on them; he simply passes
      overmistakes, the unintentional transgressions, just as
      thunder dies away. Heforgives misdeeds, the intentional
      transgressions, just as water washeseverything clean.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>Without blame.</p>
      <p>In keeping with the situation, few words are needed. The
      hindrance is past,deliverance has come. One recuperates in
      peace and keeps still. This is theright thing to do in times
      when difficulties have been overcome.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>One kills three foxes in the field And receives a yellow
      arrow. Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
      <p>The image is taken from the hunt. The hunter catches three
      cunning foxes andreceives a yellow arrow as a reward. The
      obstacles in public life are thedesigning foxes who try to
      influence the ruler through flattery. They must beremoved
      before there can be any deliverance. But the struggle must
      not becarried on with the wrong weapons. The yellow color
      points to measure and meanin proceeding against the enemy;
      the arrow signifies the straight course. Ifone devotes
      himself wholeheartedly to the task of deliverance, he
      develops somuch inner strength from his rectitude that it
      acts as a weapon against allthat is false and low.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>If a man carries a burden on his back And nonetheless
      rides in a carriage, He thereby encourages robbers to draw
      near. Perseverance leads to humiliation.</p>
      <p>This refers to a man who has come out of needy
      circumstances in to comfortand freedom from want. If now, in
      the manner of an upstart, he tries to takehis ease in
      comfortable surroundings that do not suit his nature, he
      therebyattracts robbers. If he goes on thus he is sure to
      bring disgrace uponhimself. Confucius says about this
      line:</p>
      <p>Carrying a burden on the back is the business of common
      man; a carriage isthe appurtenance of a man of rank. Now,
      when a common man uses theappurtenance of man of rank,
      robbers plot to take it away from him. If a manis insolent
      toward those above him and hard toward those below him,
      robbersplot to attack him. Carelessness in guarding things
      tempts thieves to steal.Sumptuous ornaments worn by a maiden
      are an enticement to rob her of hervirtue.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>Deliver yourself from your great toe.</p>
      <p>Then the companion comes, And him you can trust.</p>
      <p>In times of standstill it will happen that inferior people
      attach themselvesto a superior man, and through force of
      daily habit they may grow very closeto him and become
      indispensable, just as the big toe is indispensable to
      thefoot because it makes walking easier. But when the time of
      deliverance drawsnear, with its call to deeds, a man must
      free himself from such chanceacquaintances with whim he has
      no inner connection. For otherwise the friendswho share his
      views, on whom he could really rely and together with whom
      hecould accomplish something, mistrust him and stay away.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>If only the superior man can deliver himself, It brings
      good fortune.</p>
      <p>Thus he proves to inferior men that he is in earnest.</p>
      <p>Times of deliverance demand inner resolve. Inferior people
      cannot be drivenoff by prohibitions or any external means. If
      one desires to be rid of them,he must first break completely
      with them in his own mind; they will see forthemselves that
      he is in earnest and will withdraw.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>The prince shoots at a hawk on a high wall. He kills it.
      Everything serves to further.</p>
      <p>The hawk on a high wall is the symbol of a powerful
      inferior in a highposition who is hindering the deliverance.
      He withstands the force of innerinfluences, because he is
      hardened in his wickedness. He must be forciblyremoved, and
      this requires appropriate means. Confucius says about this
      line:</p>
      <p>The hawk is the object of the hunt; bow and arrow are the
      tools and means.The marksman is man (who must make proper use
      of the means to his end). Thesuperior man contains the means
      in his own person. He bides his time and thenacts. Why then
      should not everything go well? He acts and is free.
      Thereforeall he has to do is to go forth, and he takes his
      quarry. This is how a manfares who acts after he has made
      ready the means.</p>
