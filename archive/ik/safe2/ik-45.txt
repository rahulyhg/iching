45. Ts'ui / Gathering Together [Massing]

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above TUI THE JOYOUS, LAKE  below K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH

</div><div class="explanation">
 This hexagram is related in form and meaning to Pi, HOLDING TOGETHER<p> 8. In the latter, water is over the earth; here a lake is over the earth.But since the lake is a place where water collects, the idea of gatheringtogether is even more strongly expressed here than in the other hexagram. Thesame idea also arises from the fact that in the present case it is two stronglines (the fourth and the fifth) that bring about the gather together, whereasin the former case one strong line (the fifth) stands in the midst of weaklines.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 GATHERING TOGETHER. Success.<p> The king approaches his temple.  It furthers one to see the great man.

</div><div class="explanation">
 This brings success. Perseverance furthers.<p> To bring great offerings creates good fortune.  It furthers one to undertake something.<p> The gathering together of people in large communities is either a naturaloccurrence, as in the case of the family, or an artificial one, as in the caseof the state. The family gathers about the father as its head. Theperpetuation of this gathering in groups is achieved through the sacrifice tothe ancestors, at which the whole clan is gathered together. Through thecollective piety of the living members of the family, the ancestors become sointegrated in the spiritual life of the family that it cannot be dispersed ordissolved. Where men are to be gathered together, religious forces are needed.But there must also be a human leader to serve as the center of the group. Inorder to be able to bring others together, this leader must first of all becollected within himself. Only collective moral force can unite the world.Such great times of unification will leave great achievements behind them.This is the significance of the great offerings that are made. In the secularsphere likewise there is no need of great deeds in the time of GATHERINGTOGETHER.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Over the earth, the lake:  The image of GATHERING TOGETHER. Thus the superior man renews his weapons  In order to meet the unforeseen.

</div><div class="explanation">
 If the water in the lake gathers until it rises above the earth, there isdanger of a break-through. Precautions must be taken to prevent this.Similarly where men gather together in great numbers, strife is likely toarise; where possessions are collected, robbery is likely to occur. Thus inthe time of GATHERING TOGETHER we must arm promptly to ward off theunexpected. Human woes usually come as a result of unexpected events againstwhich we are not forearmed. If we are prepared, they can be prevented.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>If you are sincere, but not to the end,<p> There will sometimes be confusion, sometimes gathering together.  If you call out,<p> Then after one grasp of the hand you can laugh again.  Regret not. Going is without blame.<p> The situation is this: People desire to gather around a leader to whom theylook up. But they are in a large group, by which they allow themselves to beinfluenced, so that they waver in their decision. Thus they lack a firm centeraround which to gather. But if expression is given to this need, and if theycall for help, one grasp of the hand from the leader is enough to turn awayall distress. Therefore they must not allow themselves to be led astray. It isundoubtedly right that they should attach themselves to this leader.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>Letting oneself be drawn  Brings good fortune and remains blameless.  If one is sincere,  It furthers one to bring even a small offering.<p> In the time of GATHERING TOGETHER, we should make no arbitrary choice of theway. There are secret forces at work, leading together those who belongtogether. We must yield to this attraction; then we make no mistakes. Whereinner relationships exist, no great preparations and formalities arenecessary. People understand one another forthwith, just as the Divinitygraciously accepts a small offering if it comes from the heart.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Six in the third place means: <p>Gathering together amid sighs.<p> Nothing that would further.  Going is without blame.<p> Slight humiliation.<p> Often a man feels an urge to unite with others, but the individuals aroundhim have already formed themselves into a group, so that he remains isolated.The whole situation proves untenable. Then he ought to choose the way ofprogress, resolutely allying himself with a man who stands nearer to thecenter of the group, and can help him to gain admission to the closed circle.This is not a mistake, even though at first his position as an outsider issomewhat humiliating. 

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Nine in the fourth place means: <p>Great good fortune. No blame.<p> This describes a man who gathers people around him in the name of his ruler.Since he is not striving for any special advantages for himself but is workingunselfishly to bring about general unity, his work is crowned with success,and everything becomes as it should be. 

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Nine in the fifth place means: <p>If in gathering together one has position,<p> This brings no blame.  If there are some who are not yet sincerely in the work,<p> Sublime and enduring perseverance is needed.<p> Then remorse disappears.<p> When people spontaneously gather around a man, it is only a good. It giveshim a certain influence that can be altogether useful.. But of course there isalso the possibility that many may gather around him not because of a feelingof confidence but merely because of his influential position. This iscertainly to be regretted. The only means of dealing with such people is togain their confidence through steadfastness an intensified, unswervingdevotion to duty. In this way secret mistrust will gradually be overcome, andthere will be no occasion for regret.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Six at the top means: <p>Lamenting and sighing, floods of tears.<p> No blame.<p> It may happen that an individual would like to ally himself with another,but his good intentions are misunderstood. Then he becomes sad and laments.But this is the right course. For it may cause the other person to come to hissenses, so that the alliance that has been sought and so painfully missed isafter all achieved.
