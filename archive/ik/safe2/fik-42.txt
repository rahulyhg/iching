      The idea of increase is expressed in the fact that the strong
      lowest line ofthe upper trigram has sunk down and taken its
      place under the lower trigram.This conception also expresses
      the fundamental idea on which the Book ofChanges is based. To
      rule truly is to serve. A sacrifice of the higher elementthat
      produces an increase of the lower is called an out-and-out
      increase: itindicates the spirit that alone has power to help
      the world.

      THE JUDGMENT

    <div class="ancient">
      INCREASE. It furthers one to undertake something. It furthers
      one to cross the great water.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Sacrifice on the part of those above for the increase of
      those below fillsthe people with a sense of joy and gratitude
      that is extremely valuable forthe flowering of the
      commonwealth. When people are thus devoted to theirleaders,
      undertakings are possible, and even difficult and
      dangerousenterprises will succeed. Therefore in such times of
      progress and successfuldevelopment it is necessary to work
      and make the best use of time. This timeresembles that of the
      marriage of heaven and earth, when the earth partakes ofthe
      creative power of heaven, forming and bringing forth living
      beings. Thetime of INCREASE does not endure, therefore it
      must be utilized while itlasts.

      THE IMAGE

    <div class="ancient">
      Wind and thunder: the image of INCREASE. Thus the superior
      man: If he sees good, he imitates it; If he has faults, he
      rids himself of them.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      While observing how thunder and wind increase and strengthen
      each other, aman can not the way to self-increase and
      self-improvement. When he discoversgood in others, he should
      imitate it and thus make everything on earth hisown. If he
      perceives something bad in himself, let him rid himself of
      it. Inthis way he becomes free of evil. This ethical change
      represents the mostimportant increase of personality.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>It furthers one to accomplish great deeds.</p>
      <p>Supreme good fortune. No blame.</p>
      <p>If great help comes to a man from on high, this increased
      strength must beused to achieve something great for which he
      might otherwise never have foundenergy, or readiness to take
      responsibility. Great good fortune is produced
      byselflessness, and in bringing about great good fortune, he
      remains free ofreproach.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Six in the second place means:
      <p>Someone does indeed increase him;</p>
      <p>Ten pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it. Constant
      perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
      <p>The king presents him before God. Good fortune.</p>
      <p>A man brings about real increase by producing in himself
      the conditions forit, that it, through receptivity to and
      love of the good. Thus the thing forwhich he strives comes of
      itself, with the inevitability of natural law. Whereincrease
      is thus in harmony with the highest laws of the universe, it
      cannotbe prevented by any constellation of accidents. But
      everything depends on hisnot letting unexpected good fortune
      make him heedless; he must make it his ownthrough inner
      strength an steadfastness. Then he acquires meaning before
      Godand man, and can accomplish something for the good of the
      world.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>One is enriched through unfortunate events.</p>
      <p>No blame, if you are sincere And walk in the middle, And
      report with a seal to the prince.</p>
      <p>A time of blessing and enrichment has such powerful
      effects that even eventsordinarily unfortunate must turn out
      to the advantage of those affected bythem. These persons
      become free of error, and by acting in harmony with truththey
      gain such inner authority that they exert influence as if
      sanctioned bythe letter and seal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Six in the fourth place means:
      <p>If you walk in the middle And report the prince, He will
      follow. It furthers one to be used In the removal of the
      capital.</p>
      <p>It is important that there should be men who mediate
      between leaders andfollowers. These should be disinterested
      people, especially in times ofincrease, since the benefit is
      to spread from the leader to the people.Nothing of this
      benefit should be held back in a selfish way; it should
      reallyreach those for whom it is intended. This sort of
      intermediary, who alsoexercises a good influence on the
      leader, is especially important in timeswhen it is a matter
      of great undertakings, decisive for the future andrequiring
      the inner assent of all concerned.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>If in truth you have a kind heart, ask not.</p>
      <p>Supreme good fortune.</p>
      <p>Truly, kindness will be recognized as your virtue.</p>
      <p>True kindness does not count upon nor ask about merit and
      gratitude but actsfrom inner necessity. And such a truly kind
      heart finds itself rewarded inbeing recognized, and thus the
      beneficent influence will spread unhindered.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Nine at the top means:
      <p>He brings increase to no one. Indeed, someone even strikes
      him. He does not keep his heart constantly steady.
      Misfortune.</p>
      <p>The meaning here is that through renunciation those in
      high place shouldbring increase to those below. By neglecting
      this duty and helping no one,they in turn lose the furhtering
      influence of others and soon find themselvesalone. In this
      way they invite attacks. An attitude not permanently in
      harmonywith the demands of the time will necessarily bring
      misfortune with it.Confucius says about this line:</p>
      <p>The superior man sets his person at rest before he moves;
      he composes hismind before he speaks; he makes his relations
      firm before he asks forsomething. By attending to these three
      matters, the superior man gainscomplete security. But if a
      man is brusque in his movements, others will notcooperate. If
      he is agitated in his word, they awaken no echo in others. If
      heasks for something without having fist established
      relations, it will not begiven to him. If no one is with him,
      those who would harm him draw near.</p>
