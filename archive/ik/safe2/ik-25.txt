25. Wu Wang / Innocence (The Unexpected)

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN  below CHeN THE AROUSING, THUNDER

</div><div class="explanation">
 Ch'ien, heaven is above; Chen, movement, is below. The lower trigram Chen isunder the influence of the strong line it has received form above, fromheaven. When, in accord with this, movement follows the law of heaven, man isinnocent and without guile. His mind is natural and true, unshadowed byreflection or ulterior designs. For wherever conscious purpose is to be seen,there the truth and innocence of nature have been lost. Nature that is notdirected by the spirit is not true but degenerate nature. Starting out withthe idea of the natural, the train of thought in part goes somewhat furtherand thus the hexagram includes also the idea of the fundamental or unexpected.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 INNOCENCE. Supreme success.  Perseverance furthers.  If someone is not as he should be,  He has misfortune,  And it does not further him  To undertake anything.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Man has received from heaven a nature innately good, to guide him in all hismovements. By devotion to this divine spirit within himself, he attains anunsullied innocence that leads him to do right with instinctive sureness andwithout any ulterior thought of reward and personal advantage. Thisinstinctive certainty brings about supreme success and 'furthers throughperseverance". However, not everything instinctive is nature in this highersense of the word, but only that which is right and in accord with the will ofheaven. Without this quality of rightness, an unreflecting, instinctive way ofacting brings only misfortune. Confucius says about this: "He who departs frominnocence, what does he come to? Heaven's will and blessing do not go with hisdeeds."

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Under heaven thunder rolls:  All things attain the natural state of innocence. Thus the kings of old,  Rich in virtue, and in harmony with the time,  Fostered and nourished all beings.

</div><div class="explanation">
 In springtime when thunder, life energy, begins to move again under theheavens, everything sprouts and grows, and all beings receive for the creativeactivity of nature the childlike innocence of their original state. So it iswith the good rulers of mankind: drawing on the spiritual wealth at theircommand, they take care of all forms of life and all forms of culture and doeverything to further them, and at the proper time.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Nine at the beginning means: <p>Innocent behavior brings good fortune.<p> The original impulses of the heart are always good, so that we may followthem confidently, assured of good fortune and achievement of our aims.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>If one does not count on the harvest while plowing,<p> Nor on the use of the ground while clearing it,  It furthers one to undertake something.<p> We should do every task for its own sake as time and place demand and notwith an eye to the result. Then each task turns out well, and anything weundertake succeeds.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Six in the third place means: <p>Undeserved misfortune.<p> The cow that was tethered by someone  Is the wanderer's gain, the citizen's loss.<p> Sometimes undeserved misfortune befalls a man at the hands of another, asfor instance when someone passes by and takes a tethered cow along with him.His gain is the owner's loss. In all transactions, no matter how innocent, wemust accommodate ourselves to the demands of the time, otherwise unexpectedmisfortune overtakes us.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Nine in the fourth place means: <p>He who can be persevering  Remains without blame.  <p> We cannot lose what really belongs to us, even if we throw it away.Therefore we need have no anxiety. All that need concern us is that we shouldremain true to our own natures and not listen to others.  

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Nine in the fifth place means: <p>Use no medicine in an illness  Incurred through no fault of your own.  It will pass of itself.<p> An unexpected evil may come accidentally from without. If it does notoriginate in one's own nature or have a foothold there, one should not resortto external means to eradicate it, but should quietly let nature take itscourse. Then improvement will come of itself.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Nine at the top means: <p>Innocent action brings misfortune.<p> Nothing furthers.<p> When, in a given situation, the time is not ripe for further progress, thebest thing to do is to wait quietly, without ulterior designs. If one actsthoughtlessly and tries to push ahead in opposition to fate, success will notbe achieved.
