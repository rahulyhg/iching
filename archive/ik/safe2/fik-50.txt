      50. Ting / The Caldron
    </div>
    <div class="trigrams">
      above LI THE CLINGING, FIRE below SUN THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The six lines construct the image of Ting, THE CALDRON; at
      the bottom arethe legs, over them the belly, then come the
      ears (handles), and at the topthe carrying rings. At the same
      time, the image suggests the idea ofnourishment. The ting,
      cast of bronze, was the vessel that held the cookedviands in
      the temple of the ancestors and at banquets. The heads of the
      familyserved the food from the ting into the bowls of the
      guests. THE WELL
      <p>48 likewise has the secondary meaning of giving
      nourishment, but rather morein relation to the people. The
      ting, as a utensil pertaining to a refinedcivilization,
      suggests the fostering and nourishing of able men,
      whichredounded to the benefit of the state. This hexagram and
      THE WELL are the onlytwo in the Book of Changes that
      represent concrete, men-made objects. Yet heretoo the thought
      has its abstract connotation. Sun, below, is wood and
      wind;Li, above, is flame. Thus together they stand for the
      flame kindled by woodand wind, which likewise suggests the
      idea of preparing food.</p>

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      THE CALDRON. Supreme good fortune.
      <p>Success.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      While THE WELL relates to the social foundation of our life,
      and thisfoundation is likened to the water that serves to
      nourish growing wood, thepresent hexagram refers to the
      cultural superstructure of society. Here it isthe wood that
      serves as nourishment for the flame, the spirit. All that
      isvisible must grow beyond itself, extend into the realm of
      the invisible.Thereby it receives its true consecration and
      clarity and takes firm root inthe cosmic order. Here we see
      civilization as it reaches its culmination inreligion. The
      ting serves in offering sacrifice to God. The highest
      earthlyvalues must be sacrificed to the divine. But the truly
      divine does notmanifest itself apart from man. The supreme
      revelation of God appears inprophets and holy men. To
      venerate them is true veneration of God. The will ofGod, as
      revealed through them, should be accepted in humility; this
      bringsinner enlightenment and true understanding of the
      world, and this leads togreat good fortune and success.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Fire over wood: The image of THE CALDRON. Thus the superior
      man consolidates his fate By making his position correct.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The fate of fire depends on wood; as long as there is wood
      below, the fireburns above. It is the same in human life;
      there is in man likewise a fatethat lends power to his life.
      And if he succeeds in assigning the right placeto life and to
      fate, thus bringing the two into harmony, he puts his fate on
      afirm footing. These words contain hints about fostering of
      life as handed onby oral tradition in the secret teachings of
      Chinese yoga.

  <div class="lines">
    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>A ting with legs upturned. Furthers removal of stagnating
      stuff. One takes a concubine for the sake of her son.</p>
      <p>No blame.</p>
      <p>If a ting is turned upside down before being used, no harm
      is done-on thecontrary, this clears it of refuse. A
      concubine's position is lowly, butbecause she has a son she
      comes to be honored. These two metaphors express theidea that
      in a highly developed civilization, such as that indicated by
      thishexagram, every person of good will can in some way or
      other succeed. Nomatter how lowly he may be, provided he is
      ready to purify himself, he isaccepted. He attains a station
      in which he can prove himself fruitful inaccomplishment, and
      as a result he gains recognition.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>There is food in the ting. My comrades are envious, But
      they cannot harm me. Good fortune.</p>
      <p>In a period of advanced culture, it is of the greatest
      importance that oneshould achieve something significant. If a
      man concentrates on such realundertakings, he may indeed
      experience envy and disfavor, but that is notdangerous. The
      more he limits himself to his actual achievements, the
      lessharm the envious inflict on him.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Nine in the third place means:
      <p>The handle of the ting is altered. One is impeded in his
      way of life.</p>
      <p>The fat of the pheasant is not eaten. Once rain falls,
      remorse is spent. Good fortune comes in the end.</p>
      <p>The handle is the means for lifting up the ting. If the
      handle is altered,the ting cannot be lifted up and used, and,
      sad to say, the delicious food init, such as pheasant fat,
      cannot be eaten by anyone. This describes a man who,in a
      highly evolved civilization, finds himself in a place where
      no onenotices or recognizes him. This is a severe block to
      his effectiveness. All ofhis good qualities and gifts of mind
      thus needlessly go to waste. But if hewill only see to it
      that he is possessed of something truly spiritual, thetime is
      bound to come, sooner or later, when the difficulties will be
      resolvedand all will go well. The fall of rain symbolizes
      here, as in other instances,release of tension.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>The legs of the ting are broken.</p>
      <p>The prince's meal is spilled And his person is soiled.
      Misfortune.</p>
      <p>A man has a difficult and responsible task to which he is
      not adequate.Moreover, he does not devote himself to it with
      all his strength but goesabout with inferior people;
      therefore the execution of the work fails. In thisway he also
      incurs personal opprobrium. Confucius says about this line:
      "Weakcharacter coupled with honored place, meager knowledge
      with large plans,limited powers with heavy responsibility,
      will seldom escape disaster."</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>The ting has yellow handles, golden carrying rings.
      Perseverance furthers.</p>
      <p>Here we have, in a ruling position, a man who is
      approachable and modest innature. As a result of this
      attitude he succeeds in finding strong and ablehelpers who
      complement and aid him in his work. Having achieved this
      attitude,which requires constant self-abnegation, it is
      important for him to hold to itand not to let himself be led
      astray.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Nine at the top means:
      <p>The ting has rings of jade. Great good fortune.</p>
      <p>Nothing that would not act to further.</p>
      <p>In the preceding line the carrying rings are described as
      golden, to denotetheir strength; here they are said to be of
      jade. Jade is notable for itscombination of hardness with
      soft luster. This counsel, in relation to the manwho is open
      to it, works greatly t his advantage. Here the counsel
      isdescribed in relation to the sage who imparts it. In
      imparting it, he will bemild and pure, like precious jade.
      Thus the work finds favor in the eyes ofthe Deity, who
      dispenses great good fortune, and becomes pleasing to
      men,wherefore all goes well.</p>
