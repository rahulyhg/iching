33. TUN / Retreat

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN  below KeN KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN

</div><div class="explanation">
 The power of the dark is ascending. The light retreats to security, so thatthe dark cannot encroach upon it. This retreat is a matter not of man's willbut of natural law. Therefore in this case withdrawal is proper; it is thecorrect way to behave in order not to exhaust one's forces. In the calendarthis hexagram is linked with the sixth month (July-August), in which theforces of winter are already showing their influence.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 RETREAT. Success.  In what is small, perseverance furthers.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Conditions are such that the hostile forces favored by the time areadvancing. In this case retreat is the right course, and it is not to beconfused with flight. Flight means saving oneself under any circumstances,whereas retreat is a sign of strength. We must be careful not to miss theright moment while we are in full possession of power and position. Then weshall be able to interpret the signs of the time before it is too late and toprepare for provisional retreat instead of being drawn into a desperate life-and-death struggle. Thus we do not simple abandon the field to the opponent;we make it difficult for him to advance by showing perseverance in single actsof resistance. In this way we prepare, while retreating, for the counter-movement. Understanding the laws of a constructive retreat of this sort is noteasy. The meaning that lies hidden in such a time is important.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Mountain under heaven: the image of RETREAT. Thus the superior man keeps the inferior man at a distance,

</div><div class="explanation">
 Not angrily but with reserve.<p> The mountain rises up under heaven, but owing to its nature it finally comesto a stop. Heaven on the other hand retreats upward before it into thedistance and remains out of reach. This symbolizes the behavior of thesuperior man toward a climbing inferior; he retreats into his own thoughts asthe inferior man comes forward. He does not hate him, for hatred is a form ofsubjective involvement by which we are bound to the hated object. The superiorman shows strength (heaven) in that he brings the inferior man to a standstill(mountain) by his dignified reserve.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>At the tail in retreat. This is dangerous.  One must not wish to undertake anything.<p> Since the hexagram is the picture of something that is retreating, thelowest line represents the tail and the top line the head. In a retreat it isadvantageous to be at the front. Here one is at the back, in immediate contactwith the pursuing enemy. This is dangerous, and under such circumstances it isnot advisable to undertake anything. Keeping still is the easiest way ofescaping from the threatening danger.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>he holds him fast with yellow oxhide.<p> No one can tear him loose.<p> Yellow is the color of the middle. It indicates that which is correct and inline with duty. Oxhide is strong and not to be torn. While the superior menretreat and the inferior press after them, the inferior man represented hereholds on so firmly and tightly to the superior man that the latter cannotshake him off. And because he is in quest of what is right an so strong inpurpose, he reaches his goal. Thus the line confirms what is said in theJudgment: "In what is small" --here equivalent to "in the inferior man" --"perseverance furthers."

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>A halted retreat  Is nerve-wracking and dangerous.<p> To retain people as men- and maidservants  Brings good fortune.<p> When it is time to retreat it is both unpleasant and dangerous to be heldback, because then one no longer has freedom of action. In such a case theonly expedient is to take into one's service, so to speak, those who refuse tolet one go, so that one may at least keep one's initiative and not fallhelplessly under their domination. But even with this expedient the situationis far from satisfactory--for what can one hope to accomplish with suchservants?

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Nine in the fourth place means: <p>Voluntary retreat brings good fortune to the superior man  And downfall to the inferior man.<p> In retreating the superior man is intent on taking his departure willinglyand in all friendliness. He easily adjusts his mind to retreat, because inretreating he does not have to do violence to his convictions. The only onewho suffers is the inferior man from whom he retreats, who will degeneratewhen deprived of the guidance of the superior man. 

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Nine in the fifth place means: <p>Friendly retreat. Perseverance brings good fortune.<p> It is the business of the superior man to recognize in time that the momentfor retreat has come. If the right moment is chosen, the retreat can becarried out within the forms of perfect friendliness, without the necessity ofdisagreeable discussions. Yet, for all the observance of amenities, absolutefirmness of decision is necessary if one is not to be led astray by irrelevantconsiderations.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Nine at the top means: <p>Cheerful retreat. Everything serves to further.<p> The situation is unequivocal. Inner detachment has become an establishedfact, and we are at liberty to depart. When one sees the way ahead thusclearly, free of all doubt, a cheerful mood sets in, and one chooses what isright without further thought. Such a clear path ahead always leads to thegood<p>
