      This hexagram indicates a time when the transition from
      disorder to order isnot yet completed. The change is indeed
      prepared for, since all the lines inthe upper trigram are in
      relation to those in the lower. However, they are notyet in
      their places. While the preceding hexagram offers an analogy
      to autumn,which forms the transition from summer to winter,
      this hexagram presents aparallel to spring, which leads out
      of winter's stagnation into the fruitfultime of summer. With
      this hopeful outlook the Book of Changes come to itsclose.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      BEFORE COMPLETION. Success. But if the little fox, after
      nearly completing the crossing, Gets his tail in the water,
      <p>There is nothing that would further.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The conditions are difficult. The task is great and full of
      responsibility.It is nothing less than that of leading the
      world out of confusion back toorder. But it is a task that
      promises success, because there is a goal thatcan unite the
      forces now tending in different directions. At first,
      however,one must move warily, like an old fox walking over
      ice. The caution of a foxwalking over ice is proverbial in
      China. His ears are constantly alert to thecracking of the
      ice, as he carefully and circumspectly searches out the
      safestspots. A young fox who as yet has not acquired this
      caution goes ahead boldly,and it may happen that he falls in
      and gets his tail wet when he is almostacross the water. Then
      of course his effort has been all in vain. Accordingly,in
      times "before completion," deliberation and caution are the
      prerequisitesof success.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Fire over water: The image of the condition before
      transition. Thus the superior man is careful In the
      differentiation of things,
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      So that each finds its place.
      <p>When fire, which by nature flames upward, is above, and
      water, which flowsdownward, is below, their effects take
      opposite directions and remainunrelated. If we wish to
      achieve an effect, we must first investigate thenature of the
      forces in question and ascertain their proper place. If we
      canbring these forces to bear in the right place, they will
      have the desiredeffect and completion will be achieved. But
      in order to handle external forcesproperly, we must above all
      arrive at the correct standpoint ourselves, foronly from this
      vantage can we work correctly.</p>

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>He gets his tail in the water. Humiliating.</p>
      <p>In times of disorder there is a temptation to advance
      oneself as rapidly aspossible in order to accomplish
      something tangible. But this enthusiasm leadsonly to failure
      and humiliation if the time for achievement has not
      yetarrived. In such time it is wise to spare ourselves the
      opprobrium of failureby holding back.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>He brakes his wheels. Perseverance brings good
      fortune.</p>
      <p>Here again the time to act has not yet come. But the
      patience needed is notthat of idle waiting without thought of
      the morrow. Kept up indefinitely, thiswould not lead to any
      success. Instead, an individual must develop in himselfthe
      strength that will enable him to go forward. He must have a
      vehicle, as itwere, to effect the crossing. But he must for
      the time being use the brakes.Patience in the highest sense
      means putting brakes on strength. Therefore hemust not fall
      asleep and lose sight of the goal. If he remains strong
      andsteadfast in his resolve, all goes well in the end.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>Before completion, attack brings misfortune. It furthers
      one to cross the great water.</p>
      <p>The time of transition has arrived, but one lacks the
      strength to completethe transition. If one should attempt to
      force it, disaster would result,because collapse would then
      be unavoidable. What is to be done? A newsituation must be
      created; one must engage the energies of able helpers and
      inthis fellowship take the decisive step-cross the great
      water. Then completionwill become possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>Perseverance brings good fortune. Remorse disappears.</p>
      <p>Shock, thus to discipline the Devil's Country. For three
      years, great realms are rewarded.</p>
      <p>Now it is the time of struggle. The transition must be
      completed. We mustmake ourselves strong in resolution; this
      brings good fortune. All misgivingsthat might arise in such
      grave times of struggle must be silenced. It is aquestion of
      a fierce battle to break and to discipline the Devil's
      Country,the forces of decadence. But the struggle also has
      its reward. Now is the timeto lay the foundations of power
      and mastery for the future.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
      <p>No remorse.</p>
      <p>The light of the superior man is true. Good fortune.</p>
      <p>The victory has been won. The power of steadfastness has
      not been routed.Everything has gone well. All misgivings have
      been overcome. Success hasjustified the deed. The light of a
      superior personality shines forth anew andmakes its influence
      felt among men who have faith in it and rally around it.The
      new time has arrived, and with it good fortune. And just as
      the sun shinesforth in redoubled beauty after rain, or as a
      forest grows more freshly greenfrom charred ruins after a
      fire, so the new era appears all the more gloriousby contrast
      with the misery of the old.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Nine at the top means:
      <p>There is drinking of wine In genuine confidence. No blame.
      But if one wets his head, He loses it, in truth.</p>
      <p>Before completion, at the dawning of the new time, friends
      foregather in anatmosphere of mutual trust, and the time of
      waiting is passed in conviviality.Since the new era is hard
      on the threshold, there is no blame in this. But onemust be
      careful in all this to keep within proper bounds. If in his
      exuberancea man gets drunk, he forfeits the favorableness of
      the situation through hisintemperance.</p>
