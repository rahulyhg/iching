      43. Kuai / Break-through (Resoluteness)
    </div>
    <div class="trigrams">
      above TUI THE JOYOUS, LAKE below CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      This hexagram signifies on the one hand a break-through after
      a longaccumulation of tension, as a swollen river breaks
      through its dikes, or inthe manner of a cloudburst. On the
      other hand, applied to human conditions, itrefers to the time
      when inferior people gradually begin to disappear.
      Theirinfluence is on the wane; as a result of resolute
      action, a change inconditions occurs, a break-through. The
      hexagram is linked with the thirdmonth [April-May].

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      BREAK-THROUGH. One must resolutely make the matter known At
      the court of the king. It must be announced truthfully.
      Danger. It is necessary to notify one's own city. It does not
      further to resort to arms. It furthers one to undertake
      something.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Even if only one inferior man is occupying a ruling position
      in a city, heis able to oppress superior men. Even a single
      passion still lurking in theheart has power to obscure
      reason. Passion and reason cannot exist side byside-therefore
      fight without quarter is necessary if the good is to
      prevail.In a resolute struggle of the good against evil,
      there are, however, definiterules that must not be
      disregarded, if it is to succeed. First, resolutionmust be
      based on a union of strength and friendliness. Second, a
      compromisewith evil is not possible; evil must under all
      circumstances be openlydiscredited. Nor must our own passions
      and shortcomings be glossed over.Third, the struggle must not
      be carried on directly by force. If evil isbranded, it thinks
      of weapons, and if we do it the favor of fighting againstit
      blow for blow, we lose in the end because thus we ourselves
      get entangledin hatred and passion. Therefore it is important
      to begin at home, to be onguard in our own persons against
      the faults we have branded. In this way,finding no opponent,
      the sharp edges of the weapons of evil becomes dulled.For the
      same reasons we should not combat our own faults directly. As
      long aswe wrestle with them, they continue victorious.
      Finally, the best way to fightevil is to make energetic
      progress in the good.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      The lake has risen up to heaven: The image of BREAK-THROUGH.
      Thus the superior man Dispenses riches downward And refrains
      from resting on his virtue.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      When the water of a lake has risen up to heaven, there is
      reason to fear acloudburst. Taking this as a warning, the
      superior man forestalls a violentcollapse. If a man were to
      pile up riches for himself alone, withoutconsidering others,
      he would certainly experience a collapse. If a man were
      topile up riches for himself alone, without considering
      others, he wouldcertainly experience a collapse. For all
      gathering is followed by dispersion.Therefore the superior
      man begins to distribute while he is accumulating. Inthe same
      way, in developing his character he takes care not to become
      hardenedin obstinacy but to remain receptive to impressions
      by help of strict andcontinuous self-examination.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>Mighty in the forward-striding toes. When one goes and is
      not equal to the task, One makes a mistake.</p>
      <p>In times of resolute advance, the beginning is especially
      difficult. We feelinspired to press forward but resistance is
      still strong; therefore we oughtto gauge our own strength and
      venture only so far as we can go with certaintyof success. To
      plunge blindly ahead is wrong, because it is precisely at
      thebeginning that an unexpected setback can have the most
      disastrous results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>A cry of alarm. Arms at evening and at night. Fear
      nothing.</p>
      <p>Readiness is everything. Resolution is indissolubly bound
      up with caution.If an individual is careful and keeps his
      wits about him, he need not becomeexcited or alarmed. If he
      is watchful at all times, even before danger ispresent, he is
      armed when danger approaches and need not be afraid.
      Thesuperior man is on his guard against what is not yet in
      sight and on the alertfor what is not yet within hearing;
      therefore he dwells in the midst ofdifficulties as thought
      hey did not exist. If a man develops his character,people
      submit to him of their own accord. If reason triumphs, the
      passionswithdraw of themselves. To be circumspect and not to
      forget one's armor is theright way to security.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Nine in the third place means:
      <p>To be powerful in the cheekbones Brings misfortune.</p>
      <p>The superior man is firmly resolved. He walks alone and is
      caught in the rain. He is bespattered, And people murmur
      against him.</p>
      <p>No blame.</p>
      <p>Here we have a man in an ambiguous situation. While all
      others are engagedin a resolute fight against all that is
      inferior, he alone has a certainrelationship with an inferior
      man. If he were to show strength outwardly andturn against
      this man before the time is ripe, he would only endanger
      theentire situation, because the inferior man would too
      quickly have recourse tocountermeasures. The task of the
      superior man becomes extremely difficulthere. He must be
      firmly resolved within himself and, while
      maintainingassociation with the inferior man, avoid any
      participation in his evilness. Hewill of course be misjudged.
      It will be thought that he belong to the party ofthe inferior
      man. He will be lonely because no one will understand him.
      Hisrelations with the inferior man will sully him in the eyes
      of the multitude,and they will turn against him, grumbling.
      But he can endure this lack ofappreciation and makes no
      mistake, because he remains true to himself.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>There is no skin on his thighs, And walking comes hard. If
      a man were to let himself be led like a sheep, Remorse would
      disappear. But if these words are heard</p>
      <p>They will not be believed.</p>
      <p>Here a man is suffering from inner restlessness and cannot
      abide in hisplace. He would like to push forward under any
      circumstances, but encountersinsuperable obstacles. Thus his
      situation entails an inner conflict. This isdue to the
      obstinacy with which he seeks to enforce his will. If he
      woulddesist from this obstinacy, everything would go well.
      But this advice, like somuch other good counsel, will be
      ignored. For obstinacy makes a man unable tohear, for all
      that he has ears.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>In dealing with weeds, Firm resolution is necessary.
      Walking in the middle Remains free of blame.</p>
      <p>Weeds always grow back again and are difficult to
      exterminate. So too thestruggle against an inferior man in a
      high position demands firm resolution.One has certain
      relations with him, hence there is danger that one may give
      upthe struggle as hopeless. But this must not be. One must go
      on resolutely andnot allow himself to be deflected from him
      course. Only in this way does oneremain free of blame.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>No cry. In the end misfortune comes.</p>
      <p>Victory seems to have been achieved. There remains merely
      a remnant of theevil resolutely to be eradicated as the time
      demands. Everything looks easy.Just there, however, lies the
      danger. If we are not on guard, evil willsucceed in escaping
      by means of concealment, and when it has eluded us
      newmisfortunes will develop from the remaining seeds, for
      evil does not dieeasily. So too in dealing with the evil in
      own's own character, one must go towork with thoroughness. If
      out of carelessness anything were to be overlooked,new evil
      would arise from it.</p>
