</div><div class="trigrams">

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 DISPERSION. Success.<p> The king approaches his temple.  It furthers one to cross the great water.  Perseverance furthers.

</div><div class="explanation">
 The text of this hexagram resembles that of Ts'ui, GATHERING TOGETHER<p> 45. In the latter, the subject is the bringing together of elements thathave been separated, as water collects in lakes upon the earth. Here thesubject is the dispersing and dissolving of divisive egotism. DISPERSION showsthe way, so to speak, that leads to gathering together. This explains thesimilarity of the two texts. Religious forces are needed to overcome theegotism that divides men. The common celebration of the great sacrificialfeasts and sacred rites, which gave expression simultaneously to theinterrelation and social articulation of the family and state, was the meansof employed by the great ruler to unite men. The sacred music and the splendorof the ceremonies aroused a strong tide of emotion that was shared by allhearts in unison, and that awakened a consciousness of the common origin ofall creatures. In this way disunity was overcome and rigidity dissolved. Afurther means to the same end is co-operation in great general undertakingsthat set a high goal for the will of the people; in the common concentrationon this goal, all barriers dissolve, just as, when a boat is crossing a greatstream, all hands must unite in a joint task. But only a man who is himselffree of all selfish ulterior considerations, and who perseveres in justice andsteadfastness, is capable of so dissolving the hardness of egotism.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 The wind drives over the water:  The image of DISPERSION. Thus the kings of old sacrificed to the Lord  And built temples.

</div><div class="explanation">
 In the autumn and winter, water begins to freeze into ice. When the warmbreezes of spring come, the rigidity is dissolved, and the elements that havebeen dispersed in ice floes are reunited. It is the same with the minds of thepeople. Through hardness and selfishness the heart grows rigid, and thisrigidity leads to separation from all others. Egotism and cupidity isolatemen. Therefore the hearts of men must be seized by a devout emotion. They mustbe shaken by a religious awe in face of eternity-stirred with an intuition ofthe One Creator of all living beings, and united through the strong feeling offellowship experienced in the ritual of divine worship.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>He brings help with the strength of a horse.  Good fortune.<p> It is important that disunion should be overcome at the outset, before ithas become complete-that the clouds should be dispersed before they havebrought storm and rain. At such times when hidden divergences in temper makethemselves felt and lead to mutual misunderstandings we must take quick andvigorous action to dissolve the misunderstandings and mutual distrust.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Nine in the second place means: <p>At the dissolution  He hurries to that which supports him.  Remorse disappears.<p> When an individual discovers within himself the beginnings of alienationfrom others, of misanthropy and ill humor, he must set about dissolving theseobstructions. He must rouse himself inwardly, hasten to that which supportshim. Such support is never found in hatred, but always in a moderate and justjudgment of men, linked with good will. If he regains this unobstructedoutlook on humanity, while at the same time all saturnine ill humor isdissolved, all occasion for remorse disappears.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Six in the third place means: <p>He dissolves his self. No remorse.<p> Under certain circumstances, a man's work may become so difficult that hecan no longer think of himself. He must set aside all personal desires anddisperse whatever the self gathers about it to serve as a barrier againstothers. Only on the basis of great renunciation can he obtain the strength forgreat achievements. By setting his goal in a great task outside himself, hecan attain this standpoint.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>He dissolves his bond with his group.<p> Supreme good fortune.  Dispersion leads in turn to accumulation.<p> This is something that ordinary men do not think of.<p> When we are working at a task that affects the general welfare, we mustleave all private friendships out of account. Only by rising above partyinterests can we achieve something decisive. He who has the courage thus toforego what is near wins what is afar. But in order to comprehend thisstandpoint, one must have a wide view of the interrelationships of life, suchas only unusual men attain.  

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Nine in the fifth place means: <p>His loud cries are as dissolving as sweat.  Dissolution! A king abides without blame.<p> In times of general dispersion and separation, a great idea provides a focalpoint for the organization of recovery. Just as an illness reaches its crisisin a dissolving sweat, so a great stimulating idea is a true salvation intimes of general deadlock. It gives the people a rallying point-a man in aruling position who can dispel misunderstandings.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Nine at the top means: <p>He dissolves his blood.  Departing, keeping at a distance, going out,  Is without blame.<p> The idea of the dissolving of a man's blood means the dispersion of thatwhich might lead to bloodshed and wounds, i.e., avoidance of danger. But herethe thought is not that a man avoids difficulties for himself alone, butrather that he rescues his kin-helps them to get away before danger comes, orto keep at a distance from an existing danger, or to find a way out of adanger that is already upon them. In this way he does what is right.
