48. Ching / The Well

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above K'AN THE ABYSMAL, WATER  below SUN THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD

</div><div class="explanation">
 Wood is below, water above. The wood goes down into the earth to bring upwater. The image derives from the pole-and-bucket well of ancient China. Thewood represents not the buckets, which in ancient times were made of clay, butrather the wooden poles by which the water is hauled up from the well. Theimage also refers to the world of plants, which lift water out of the earth bymeans of their fibers. The well from which water is drawn conveys the furtheridea of an inexhaustible dispensing of nourishment.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 THE WELL. The town may be changed,  But the well cannot be changed.  It neither decreases nor increases.<p> They come and go and draw from the well.  If one gets down almost to the water  And the rope does not go all the way,  Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.

</div><div class="explanation">
 In ancient China the capital cities were sometimes moved, partly for thesake of more favorable location, partly because of a change in dynasties. Thestyle of architecture changed in the course of centuries, but the shape of thewell has remained the same from ancient times to this day. Thus the well isthe symbol of that social structure which, evolved by mankind in meeting itsmost primitive needs, is independent of all political forms. Politicalstructures change, as do nations, but the life of man with its needs remainseternally the same-this cannot be changed. Life is also inexhaustible. Itgrows neither less not more; it exists for one and for all. The generationscome and go, and all enjoy life in its inexhaustible abundance. However, thereare two prerequisites for a satisfactory political or social organization ofmankind. We must go down to the very foundations of life. For any merelysuperficial ordering of life that leaves its deepest needs unsatisfied is asineffectual as if no attempt at order had ever been made. Carelessness-bywhich the jug is broken-is also disastrous. If for instance the militarydefense of a state is carried to such excess that it provokes wars by whichthe power of the state is annihilated, this is a breaking of the jug. Thishexagram applies also to the individual. However men may differ in dispositionand in education, the foundations of human nature are the same in everyone.And every human being can draw in the course of his education from theinexhaustible wellspring of the divine in man's nature. But here likewise twodangers threaten: a man may fail in his education to penetrate to the realroots of humanity and remain fixed in convention-a partial education of thissort is as bad as none- or he may suddenly collapse and neglect his self-development.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Water over wood: the image of THE WELL. Thus the superior man encourages the people at their work,  And exhorts them to help one another.

</div><div class="explanation">
 The trigram Sun, wood, is below, and the trigram K'an, water, is above it.Wood sucks water upward. Just as wood as an organism imitates the action ofthe well, which benefits all parts of the plant, the superior man organizeshuman society, so that, as in a plant organism, its parts co-operate for thebenefit of the whole.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>One does not drink the mud of the well.<p> No animals come to an old well.<p> If a man wanders around in swampy lowlands, his life is submerged in mud.Such a man loses all significance for mankind. He who throws himself away isno longer sought out by others. In the end no one troubles about him any more.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Nine in the second place means: <p>At the well hole one shoots fishes.<p> The jug is broken and leaks.<p> The water itself is clear, but it is not being used. Thus the well is aplace where only fish will stay, and whoever comes to it, comes only to catchfish. But the jug is broken, so that the fish cannot be kept in it. Thisdescribes the situation of a person who possesses good qualities but neglectsthem. No one bothers about him. As a result he deteriorates in mind. Heassociates with inferior men and can no longer accomplish anything worthwhile.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>The well is cleaned, but no one drinks from it.<p> This is my heart's sorrow,  For one might draw from it.  If the king were clear-minded,  Good fortune might be enjoyed in common.<p> An able man is available. He is like a purified well whose water isdrinkable. But no use is made of him. This is the sorrow of those who knowhim. One wishes that the prince might learn about it; this would be goodfortune for all concerned.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>The well is being lined. No blame.<p> True, if a well is being lined with sone, it cannot be used while the workis going on. But the work is not in vain; the result is that the water staysclear. In life also there are times when a man must put himself in order.During such a time he can do nothing for others, but his work is nonethelessvaluable, because by enhancing his powers and abilities through innerdevelopment, he can accomplish all the more later on. 

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Nine in the fifth place means: <p>In the well there is a clear, cold spring  From which one can drink.<p> A well that is fed by a spring of living water is a good well. A man who hasvirtues like a well of this sort is born to be a leader and savior of men, forhe has the water of life. Nevertheless, the character for "good fortune" isleft out here. The all-important thing about a well is that its water bedrawn. The best water is only a potentiality for refreshment as long as it isnot brought up. So too with leaders of mankind: it is all-important that oneshould drink from the spring of their words and translate them into life.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Six at the top means: <p>One draws from the well  Without hindrance.  It is dependable.<p> Supreme good fortune.<p> The well is there fore all. No one is forbidden to take water from it. Nomatter how many come, all find what they need, for the well is dependable. Ithas a spring and never runs dry. Therefore it is a great blessing to the wholeland. The same is true of the really great man, whose inner wealth isinexhaustible; the more that people draw from him, the greater his wealthbecomes.
