      44. Kou / Coming to Meet
    </div>
    <div class="trigrams">
      above CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN below SUN THE GENTLE, WIND
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      This hexagram indicates a situation in which the principle of
      darkness,after having been eliminated, furtively and
      unexpectedly obtrudes again fromwithin and below. Of its own
      accord the female principle comes to meet themale. It is an
      unfavorable and dangerous situation, and we must understand
      andpromptly prevent the possible consequences. The hexagram
      is linked with thefifth month [June-July], because at the
      summer solstice the principle ofdarkness gradually becomes
      ascendant again.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      COMING TO MEET. The maiden is powerful. One should not marry
      such a maiden.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The rise of the inferior element is pictured here in the
      image of a boldgirl who lightly surrenders herself and thus
      seizes power. This would not bepossible if the strong and
      light-giving element had not in turn come halfway.The
      inferior thing seems so harmless and inviting that a man
      delights in it;it looks so small and weak that he imagines he
      may dally with it and come tono harm. The inferior man rises
      only because the superior man does not regardhim as dangerous
      and so lends him power. If he were resisted from the fist,
      hecould never gain influence. The time of COMING TO MEET is
      important in stillanother way. Although as a general rule the
      weak should not come to meet thestrong, there are times when
      this has great significance. When heaven andearth come to
      meet each other, all creatures prosper; when a prince and
      hisofficial come to meet each other, the world is put in
      order. It is necessaryfor elements predestined to be joined
      and mutually dependent to come to meetone another halfway.
      But the coming together must be free of dishonestulterior
      motives, otherwise harm will result.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Under heaven, wind: The image of COMING TO MEET. Thus does
      the prince act when disseminating his commands And
      proclaiming them to the four quarters of heaven.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The situation here resembles that in hexagram 20, Kuan,
      CONTEMPLATION (VIEW). In the latter the wind blows over the
      earth, here it blows underheaven; in both cases it goes
      everywhere. There the wind is on the earth andsymbolizes the
      ruler taking note of the conditions in his kingdom; here
      thewind blows from above and symbolizes the influence
      exercised by the rulerthrough his commands. Heaven is far
      from the things of earth, but it sets themin motion by means
      of the wind. The ruler is far form his people, but he
      setsthem in motion by means of his commands and decrees.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>It must be checked with a brake of bronze. Perseverance
      brings good fortune. If one lets it take its course, one
      experiences misfortune. Even a lean pig has it in him to rage
      around.</p>
      <p>If an inferior element has wormed its way in, it must be
      energeticallychecked at once. By consistently checking it,
      bad effects can be avoided. Ifit is allowed to take its
      course, misfortune is bound to result; theinsignificance of
      that which creeps in should not be a temptation to
      underrateit. A pig that is still young and lean cannot rage
      around much, but after ithas eaten its fill and become
      strong, its true nature comes out if it has notpreviously
      been curbed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>There is a fish in the tank. No blame. Does not further
      guests.</p>
      <p>The inferior element is not overcome by violence but is
      kept under gentlecontrol. Then nothing evil is to be feared.
      But care must be taken not to letit come in contact with
      those further away, because once free it would unfoldits evil
      aspects unchecked.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Nine in the third place means: There is no skin on his
      thighs, And walking comes hard. If one is mindful of the
      danger,
      <p>No great mistake is made.</p>
      <p>There is a temptation to fall in with the evil element
      offering itself-avery dangerous situation. Fortunately
      circumstances prevent this; one wouldlike to do it, but
      cannot. This leads to painful indecision in behavior. Butif
      we gain clear insight into the danger of the situation, we
      shall at leastavoid more serious mistakes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>No fish in the tank.</p>
      <p>This leads to misfortune.</p>
      <p>Insignificant people must be tolerated in order to keep
      them well disposed.Then we can make use of them if we should
      need them. If we become alienatedfrom them and do not meet
      them halfway, they turn their backs on us and arenot at our
      disposal when we need them. But this is our own fault.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>A melon covered with willow leaves. Hidden lines.</p>
      <p>Then it drops down to one from heave.</p>
      <p>The melon, like the fish, is a symbol of the principle of
      darkness. It issweet but spoils easily and for this reason is
      protected with a cover ofwillow leaves. This is a situation
      in which a strong, superior, well-poisedman tolerates and
      protects the inferiors in his charge. He has the firm linesof
      order an beauty within himself but he does not lay stress
      upon them. Hedoes not bother his subordinates with outward
      show or tiresome admonitions butleaves them quite free,
      putting his trust in the transforming power of astrong and
      upright personality. And behold! Fate is favorable. His
      inferiorsrespond to his influence and fall to his disposition
      like ripe fruit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Nine at the top means:
      <p>He comes to meet with his horns. Humiliation. No
      blame.</p>
      <p>When a man has withdrawn from the world, its tumult often
      becomes unbearableto him. There are many people who in a
      noble pride hold themselves aloof fromall that is low and
      rebuff it brusquely wherever it comes to meet them.
      Suchpersons are reproached for being proud and distant, but
      since active duties nolonger hold them to the world, this
      does not greatly matter. They know how tobear the dislike of
      the masses with composure.</p>
