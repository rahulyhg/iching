 above KeN KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN  below TUI THE JOYOUS, LAKE

</div><div class="explanation">
 This hexagram represents a decrease of the lower trigram in favor of theupper, because the third line, originally strong, has moved up to the top, andthe top line, originally weak, has replaced it. What is below is decreased tothe benefit of what is above. This is out-and-out decrease. If the foundationsof a building are decreased in strength and the upper walls are strengthened,the whole structure loves its stability. Likewise, a decrease in theprosperity of the people in favor of the government is out-and-out decrease.And the entire theme of the hexagram is directed to showing how this shift ofwealth can take place without causing the sources of wealth can take placewithout causing the sources of wealth in the nation and its lower classes tofail.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 DECREASE combined with sincerity  Brings about supreme good fortune  Without blame.  One may be persevering in this.  It furthers one to undertake something.  How is this to be carried out?  One may use two small bowls for the sacrifice.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Decrease does not under all circumstances mean something bad. Increase anddecrease come in their own time. What matters here is to understand the timeand not to try to cover up poverty with empty pretense. If a time of scantyresources brings out an inner truth, one must not feel ashamed of simplicity.For simplicity is then the very thing needed to provide inner strength forfurther undertakings. Indeed, there need by no concern if the outward beautyof the civilization, even the elaboration of religious forms, should have tosuffer because of simplicity. One must draw on the strength of the innerattitude to compensate for what is lacking in externals; then the power of thecontent makes up for the simplicity of form. There is no need of presentingfalse appearances to God. Even with slender means, the sentiment of the heartcan be expressed.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 At the foot of the mountain, the lake:  The image of DECREASE. Thus the superior man controls his anger  And restrains his instincts.

</div><div class="explanation">
 The lake at the foot of the mountain evaporates. In this way it decreases tothe benefit of the mountain, which is enriched by its moisture. The mountainstands as the symbol of stubborn strength that can harden into anger. The lakeis the symbol of unchecked gaiety that can develop into passionate drives atthe expense of the life forces. Therefore decrease is necessary; anger must bedecreased by keeping still, the instincts must be curbed by restriction. Bythis decrease of the lower powers of the psyche, the higher aspects of thesoul are enriched/

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Nine at the beginning means: <p>Going quickly when one's tasks are finished  Is without blame.  But one must reflect on how much one may decrease others.<p> It is unselfish and good when a man, after completing his own urgent tasks,uses his strength in the service of others, and without bragging or makingmuch of it, helps quickly where help is needed. But the man in a superiorposition who is thus aided must weigh carefully how much he can accept withoutdoing the helpful servant or friend real harm. Only where such delicacy offeeling exists can one give oneself unconditionally and without hesitation.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Nine in the second place means: <p>Perseverance furthers.<p> To undertake something brings misfortune.  Without decreasing oneself,  One is able to bring increase to others.<p> A high-minded self-awareness and a consistent seriousness with no forfeit ofdignity are necessary if a man wants to be of service to others. He who throwhimself away in order to do the bidding of a superior diminishes his ownposition without thereby giving lasting benefit to the other. This is wrong.To render true service of lasting value to another, one must serve him withoutrelinquishing oneself.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Six in the third place means: <p>When three people journey together,<p> Their number increases by one.  When one man journeys alone,  He finds a companion.<p> When there are three people together, jealousy arises. One of them will haveto go. Avery close bond is possible only between two people. But when one manis lonely, he is certain to find a companion who complements him.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>If a man deceases his faults,  It makes the other hasten to come and rejoice.<p> No blame.<p> A man's faults often prevent even well-disposed people from coming closer tohim. His faults are sometimes reinforced by the environment in which he lives.But if in humility he can bring himself to the point of giving them up, hefrees his well-disposed friends from an inner pressure and causes them toapproach the more quickly, and there is mutual joy. 

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Six in the fifth place means: <p>Someone does indeed increase him.<p> Ten pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it.<p> Supreme good fortune.  <p> If someone is marked out by fate for good fortune, it comes without fail.All oracles-as for instance those that are read from the shells of tortoises-are bound to concur in giving him favorable signs. He need fear nothing,because his luck is ordained from on high.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Nine at the top means: <p>If one is increased without depriving other,<p> There is no blame.  Perseverance brings good fortune.  It furthers one to undertake something.  One obtains servants  But no longer has a separate home.<p> There are people who dispense blessings to the whole world. Every increasein power that comes to them benefits the whole of mankind and therefore doesnot bring decrease to others. Through perseverance and zealous work a man winssuccess and finds helpers as they are needed. But what he accomplishes is nota limited private advantage; it is a public good and available to everyone.
