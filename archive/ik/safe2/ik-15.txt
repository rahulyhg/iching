15. Ch'ien / Modesty

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH  below KEN KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN

</div><div class="explanation">
 This hexagram is made up of the trigrams Ken, Keeping Still, mountain, andK'un. The mountain is the youngest son of the Creative, the representative ofheaven and earth. It dispenses the blessings of heaven, the clouds and rainthat gather round its summit, and thereafter shines forth radiant withheavenly light. This shows what modesty is and how it functions in great andstrong men. K'un, the earth, stands above. Lowliness is a quality of theearth: this is the very reason why it appears in this hexagram as exalted, bybeing placed above the mountain. This shows how modesty functions in lowly,simple people: they are lifted up by it.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 MODESTY creates success.<p> . The superior man carries things through.

</div><div class="explanation">
 It is the law of heaven to make fullness empty and to make full what ismodest; when the sun is at its zenith, it must, according to the law ofheaven, turn toward its setting, and at its nadir it rises toward a new dawn.In obedience to the same law, the moon when it is full begins to wane, andwhen empty of light it waxes again. This heavenly law works itself out in thefates of men also. It is the law of earth to alter the full and to contributeto the modest. High mountains are worn down by the waters, and the valleys arefilled up. It is the law of fate to undermine what is full and to prosper themodest. And men also hate fullness and love the modest. The destinies of menare subject to immutable laws that must fulfill themselves. But man has it inhis power to shape his fate, according as his behavior exposes him to theinfluence of benevolent or of destructive forces. When a man holds a highposition and is nevertheless modest, he shines with the light of wisdom; if heis in a lowly position and is modest, he cannot be passed by. Thus thesuperior man can carry out his work to the end without boasting of what he hasachieved.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Within the earth, a mountain: The image of MODESTY.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Thus the superior man reduces that which is too much,  And augments that which is too little.  He weighs things and makes them equal.<p> The wealth of the earth in which a mountain is hidden is not visible to theeye, because the depths are offset by the height of the mountain. Thus highand low competent each other and the result is the plain. Here an effect thatit took a long time to achieve, but that in the end seems easy ofaccomplishment and self-evident, is used as the image of modesty. The superiorman does the same thing when he establishes order in the world; he equalizesthe extremes that are the source of social discontent and thereby creates justand equable conditions.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>A superior man modest about his modesty  May cross the great water.  Good fortune.<p> A dangerous enterprise, such as the crossing of a great stream, is made muchmore difficult if many claims and considerations have to be taken intoaccount. On the other hand, the task is easy if it is attended to quickly andsimply. Therefore the unassuming attitude of mind that goes with modesty fitsa man to accomplish even difficult undertakings: he imposes no demands orstipulations but settles matters easily and quickly. Where no claims are putforward, no resistances arise.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>Modesty that comes to expression. Perseverance brings good fortune.<p> "Out of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh." When a man's attitudeof mind is so modest that this expresses itself in his outward behavior, it isa source of good fortune to him. For the possibility of exerting a lastinginfluence arises of itself and no one can interfere.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>A superior man of modesty and merit  Carries things to conclusion.  Good fortune.<p> This is the center of the hexagram, where its secret is disclosed. Adistinguished name is readily earned by great achievements. If a man allowshimself to be dazzled by fame, he will soon be criticized, and difficultieswill arise. If, on the contrary, he remains modest despite his merit, he makeshimself beloved and wins the support necessary for carrying his work throughto the end.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>Nothing that would not further modesty  In movement.<p> Everything has its proper measure. Even modesty in behavior can be carriedtoo far. Here, however, it is appropriate, because the place between a worthyhelper below and a kindly ruler above carries great responsibility. Theconfidence of the man in superior place must not be abused nor the merits ofthe man in inferior placed concealed. There are officials who indeed do notstrive for prominence; they hide behind the letter of ordinances, decline allresponsibility, accept pay without giving its equivalent in work, and bearempty titles. This is the opposite of what is meant here by modesty. In such aposition, modesty is shown by interest in one's work.

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Six in the fifth place means: <p>No boasting of wealth before one's neighbor.  It is favorable to attack with force.  Nothing that would not further.<p> Modesty is not to be confused with weak good nature that lets things taketheir own course. When a man holds a responsible position, he must at timesresort to energetic measures. In doing so he must not try to make animpression by boasting of his superiority but must make certain of the peoplearound him. The measures taken should be purely objective and in no waypersonally offensive. Thus modesty manifests itself even in severity.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Six at the top means: <p>Modesty that comes to expression.  It is favorable to set armies marching  To chastise one's own city and one's country.<p> A person who is really sincere in his modesty must make it show in reality.He must proceed with great energy in this. When enmity arises nothing iseasier than to lay the blame on another. A weak man takes offense perhaps, anddraws back, feeling self-pity; he thinks that it is modesty that keeps himfrom defending himself. Genuine modesty sets one to creating order andinspires one to begin by disciplining one's own ego and one's immediatecircle. Only through having the courage to marshal one's armies againstoneself, will something forceful really be achieved.
