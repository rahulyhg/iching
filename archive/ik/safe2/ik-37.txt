 The hexagram represents the laws obtaining within the family. The strongline at the top represents the father, the lowest the son. The strong line inthe fifth place represents the husband, the yielding second line the wife. Onthe other hand, the two strong lines in the fifth and the third placerepresent two brothers, and the two weak lines correlated with them in thefourth and the second place stand for their respective wives. Thus all theconnections and relationships within the family find their appropriateexpression. Each individual line has the character according with its place.The fact that a strong line occupies the sixth place-where a weak line mightbe expected-indicates very clearly the strong leadership that must come fromthe head of the family. The line is to be considered here not in its qualityas the sixth but in its quality as the top line. THE FAMILY shows the lawsoperative within the household that, transferred to outside life, keep thestate and the world in order. The influence that goes out from within thefamily is represented by the symbol of the wind created by fire.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 THE FAMILY. The perseverance of the woman furthers.

</div><div class="explanation">
 The foundation of the family is the relationship between husband and wife.The tie that hold the family together lies in the loyalty and perseverance ofthe wife. The tie that holds the family together lies in the loyalty andperseverance of the wife. Her place is within (second line), while that of thehusband is without (fifth line). It is in accord with the great laws of naturethat husband and wife take their proper places. Within the family a strongauthority is needed; this is represented by the parents. If the father isreally a father and the son a son, if the elder brother fulfills his position,and the younger fulfills his, if the husband is really a husband and the wifea wife, then the family is in order. When the family is in order, all thesocial relationships of mankind will be in order. Three of the five socialrelationships are to be found within the family-that between father and son,which is the relation of love, that between the husband and wife, which is therelation of chaste conduct, and that between elder and younger brother, whichis the relation of correctness. The loving reverence of the son is thencarried over to the prince in the form of faithfulness to duty; the affectionand correctness of behavior existing between the two brothers are extended toa friend in the form of loyalty, and to a person of superior rank in the formof deference. The family is society in the embryo; it is the native soil onwhich performance of moral duty is made early through natural affection, sothat within a small circle a basis of moral practice is created, and this islater widened to include human relationships in general.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Wind comes forth from fire: The image of THE FAMILY.Thus the superior man has substance in his words  And duration in his way of life.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Heat creates energy: this is signified by the wind stirred up by the fireand issuing forth form it. This represents influence working from withinoutward. The same thing is needed in the regulation of the family. Here toothe influence on others must proceed form one's own person. In order to becapable of producing such an influence, one's words must have power, and thisthey can have only if they are based on something real, just as flame dependson its fuel Words have influence only when they are pertinent and clearlyrelated to definite circumstances. General discourses and admonitions have noeffect whatsoever. Furthermore, the words must be supported by one's entireconduct, just as the wind is made effective by am impression on others thatthey can adapt and conform to it. If words and conduct are not in accord andconsistent, they will have no effect.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Nine at the beginning means: <p>Firm seclusion within the family.  Remorse disappears.<p> The family must form a well-defined unit within which each member knows hisplace. From the beginning each child must be accustomed to firmly establishedrules of order, before ever its will is directed to other things. If we begintoo late to enforce order, when the will of the child has already beenoverindulged, the whims and passions, grown stronger with the years, offerresistance and give cause for remorse. If we insist on order from the outset,occasions for remorse may arise-in general social life these are unavoidable-but the remorse always disappears again, and everything rights itself. Forthere is nothing easily avoided and more difficult to carry through than"breaking a child's will." 

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>She should not follow her whims.<p> She must attend within to the food.  Perseverance brings good fortune.<p> The wife must always be guided by the will of the master of the house, be hefather, husband, or grown son. There, without having to look for them, she hasgreat and important duties. She must attend to the nourishment of her familyand to the food for the sacrifice. IN this way she becomes the center of thesocial and religious life of the family, and her perseverance in this positionbrings good fortune to the whole house. In relation to general conditions, thecounsel here is to seek nothing by means of force, but quietly to confineoneself to the duties at hand.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>When tempers flare up in the family,<p> Too great severity brings remorse.  Good fortune nonetheless.  When woman and chile dally and laugh  It leads in the end to humiliation.<p> In the family the proper mean between severity and indulgence ought toprevail. Too great severity toward one's own flesh and blood leads to remorse.The wise thing is to build strong dikes within which complete freedom ofmovement is allowed each individual. But in doubtful instances too greatseverity, despite occasional mistakes, is preferable, because it preservesdiscipline in the family, whereas too great weakness leads to disgrace.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>She is the treasure of the house.  Great good fortune.<p> It is upon the woman of the house that the well-being of the family depends.Well-being prevails when expenditures and income are soundly balanced. Thisleads to great good fortune. In the sphere of public life, this line refers tothe faithful steward whose measures further the general welfare.  

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Nine in the fifth place means: <p>As a king he approaches his family.  Fear not.  Good fortune.<p> A king is the symbol of a fatherly man who is richly endowed in mind. Hedoes nothing to make himself feared; on the contrary, the whole family cantrust him, because love governs their intercourse. His character of itselfexercises the right influence.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Nine at the top means: <p>His work commands respect.'  In the end good fortune comes.<p> In the last analysis, order within the family depends on the character ofthe master of the house. If he cultivates his personality so that it worksimpressively through the force of inner truth, all goes well with the family.In a ruling position one must of his own accord assume responsibility.
