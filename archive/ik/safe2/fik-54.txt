      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      THE MARRYING MAIDEN. Undertakings bring misfortune.
      <p>Nothing that would further.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      A girl who is taken into the family, but not as the chief
      wife, must behavewith special caution and reserve. She must
      not take it upon herself tosupplant the mistress of the
      house, for that would mean disorder and lead tountenable
      relationships. The same is true of all voluntary
      relationshipsbetween human beings. While legally regulated
      relationships based on personalinclination depend in the long
      run entirely on tactful reserve. Affection asthe essential
      principle of relatedness is of the greatest importance in
      allrelationships in the world. For the union of heaven and
      earth is the origin ofthe whole of nature. Among human beings
      likewise, spontaneous affection is theall-inclusive principle
      of union.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Thunder over the lake: The image of THE MARRYING MAIDEN. Thus
      the superior man Understands the transitory In the light of
      the eternity of the end.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Thunder stirs the water of the lake, which follows it in
      shimmering waves.This symbolizes the girl who follows the man
      of her choice. But everyrelationship between individuals
      bears within it the danger that wrong turnsmay be taken,
      leading to endless misunderstandings and
      disagreements.Therefore it is necessary constantly to remain
      mindful of the end. If wepermit ourselves to drift along, we
      come together and are parted again as theday may determine.
      If on the other hand a man fixes his mind on an end
      thatendures, he will succeed in avoiding the reefs that
      confront the closerrelationships of people.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>The marrying maiden as a concubine. A lame man who is able
      to tread. Undertakings bring good fortune.</p>
      <p>The princess of ancient China maintained a fixed order of
      rank among thecourt ladies, who were subordinated to the
      queen as are younger sisters to theeldest. Frequently they
      came from the family of the queen, who herself ledthem to her
      husband. The meaning is that a girl entering a family with
      theconsent of the wife will not rank outwardly as the equal
      of the latter butwill withdraw modestly into the background.
      However, if she understands how tofit herself into the
      pattern of things, her position will be entirelysatisfactory,
      and she will feel sheltered in the love of the husband to
      whomshe bears children. The same meaning is brought out in
      the relationshipsbetween officials. A man may enjoy the
      personal friendship of a prince and betaken into his
      confidence. Outwardly this man must keep tactfully in
      thebackground behind the official ministers of state, but,
      although he ishampered by this status, as if he were lame, he
      can nevertheless accomplishsomething through the kindliness
      of his nature.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>A one-eyed man who is able to see.</p>
      <p>The perseverance of a solitary man furthers.</p>
      <p>Here the situation is that of a girl married to a man who
      has disappointedher. Man and wife ought to work together like
      a pair of eyes. Here the girl isleft behind in loneliness;
      the man of her choice either has become unfaithfulor has
      died. But she does not lost the inner light of loyalty.
      Thought theother eye is gone, she maintains her loyalty even
      in loneliness.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>The marrying maiden as a slave.</p>
      <p>She marries as a concubine.</p>
      <p>A girl who is in a lowly position and finds no husband
      may, in somecircumstances, still win shelter as a concubine.
      This pictures the situationof a person who longs too much for
      joys that cannot be obtained in the usualway. He enters upon
      a situation not altogether compatible with
      self-esteem.Neither judgment nor warning is added to this
      line; it merely lays bare theactual situation, so that
      everyone may draw a lesson from it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>The marrying maiden draws out the allotted time. A late
      marriage comes in due course.</p>
      <p>The girl is virtuous. She does not wish to throw herself
      away, and allowsthe customary time for marriage to slip by.
      However, there is no harm in this;she is rewarded for her
      purity and, even though belatedly, finds the husbandintended
      for her.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>The sovereign I gave his daughter in marriage.</p>
      <p>The embroidered garments of the princess Were not as
      gorgeous As those of the serving maid.</p>
      <p>The moon that is nearly full Brings good fortune.</p>
      <p>The sovereign I is T'ang the Completer. This ruler decreed
      that the imperialprincesses should be subordinated to their
      husbands in the same manner asother women (cf. Hexagram</p>
      <p>11, six in the fifth place). The emperor does not wait for
      a suitor to woohis daughter but gives her in marriage when he
      sees fit. Therefore it is inaccord with custom for the girl's
      family to take the initiative here. We seehere a girl of
      aristocratic birth who marries a man of modest
      circumstancesand understands how to adapt herself with grace
      to the new situation. She isfree of all vanity of outer
      adornment, and forgetting her rank in hermarriage, takes a
      place below that of her husband, just as the moon, before
      itis quite full, does not directly face the sun.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>The woman holds the basket, but there are no fruits in
      it.</p>
      <p>The man stabs the sheep, but no blood flows.</p>
      <p>Nothing that acts to further.</p>
      <p>At the sacrifice to the ancestors, the woman had to
      present harvestofferings in a basket, while the man
      slaughtered the sacrificial animal withhis own hand. Here the
      ritual is only superficially fulfilled; the woman takesan
      empty basket and the man stabs a sheep slaughtered
      beforehand-solely topreserve the forms. This impious,
      irreverent attitude bodes no good for amarriage.</p>
