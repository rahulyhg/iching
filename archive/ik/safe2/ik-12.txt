12. P'i / Standstill [Stagnation]

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN  below K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH

</div><div class="explanation">
 This hexagram is the opposite of the preceding one. Heaven is above, drawingfarther and farther away, while the earth below sinks farther into the depths.The creative powers are not in relation. It is a time of standstill anddecline. This hexagram is linked with the seventh month (August-September),when the year has passed its zenith and autumnal decay is setting in.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 STANDSTILL. Evil people do not further  The perseverance of the superior man.  The great departs; the small approaches.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Heaven and earth are out of communion and all things are benumbed. What isabove has no relation to what is below, and on earth confusion and disorderprevail. The dark power is within, the light power is without. Weakness iswithin, harshness without. Within are the inferior, and without are thesuperior. The way of inferior people is in ascent; the way of superior peopleis one the decline. But the superior people do not allow themselves to beturned from their principles. If the possibility of exerting influence isclosed to them, they nevertheless remain faithful to their principles andwithdraw into seclusion.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Heaven and earth do not unite:  The image of STANDSTILL.  Thus the superior man falls back upon his inner worth  In order to escape the difficulties.  He does not permit himself to be honored with revenue.

</div><div class="explanation">
 When, owing to the influence of inferior men, mutual mistrust prevails inpublic life, fruitful activity is rendered impossible, because the fundamentsare wrong. Therefore the superior man knows what he must do under suchcircumstances; he does not allow himself to be tempted by dazzling offers totake part in public activities. This would only expose him to danger, since hecannot assent to the meanness of the others. He therefore hides his worth andwithdraws into seclusion.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>When ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it.  Each according to his kind.  Perseverance brings good fortune and success.<p> The text is almost the same as that of the first line of the precedinghexagram, but with a contrary meaning. In the latter a man is drawing anotheralong with him on the road to an official career; here a man is drawinganother with him into retirement form public life. This is why the text sayshere, "Perseverance brings good fortune and success," and not "Undertakingsbring good fortune." If it becomes impossible to make our influence count, itis only by retirement that we spare ourselves humiliation. Success in a highersense can be ours, because we know how to safeguard the value of ourpersonalities.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>They bear and endure;  This means good fortune for inferior people.  The standstill serves to help the great man to attain success.<p> Inferior people are ready to flatter their superiors in a servile way. Theywould also endure the superior man if he would put an end to their confusion.This is fortunate for them. But the great man calmly bears the consequences ofthe standstill. He does not mingle with the crowd of the inferior; that is nothis place. By his willingness to suffer personally he insures the success ofhis fundamental principles.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Six in the third place means: <p>They bear shame.<p> Inferior people who have risen to power illegitimately do not feel equal tothe responsibility they have taken upon themselves. In their hearts they beginto be ashamed, although at first they do not show it outwardly. This marks aturn for the better.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Nine in the fourth place means: <p>He who acts at the command of the highest  Remains without blame.  Those of like mind partake of the blessing.<p> The time of standstill is nearing the point of change into its opposite.Whoever wishes to restore order must feel himself called to the task and havethe necessary authority. A man who sets himself up a capable of creating orderaccording to his own judgment could make mistakes and end in failure. But theman who is truly called to the task is favored by the conditions of the time,and all those of like mind will share in his blessing.  

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Nine in the fifth place means: <p>Standstill is giving way.  Good fortune for the great man.  "What if it should fail, what if it should fail?"  In this way he ties it to a cluster of mulberry shoots.<p> The time undergoes a change. The right man, able to restore order, hasarrived. Hence "good fortune." But such periods of transition are the verytimes in which we must fear and tremble. Success is assured only throughgreatest caution, which asks always, "What if it should fail?" When a mulberrybush is cut down, a number of unusually strong shoots sprout from the roots.Hence the image of tying something to a cluster of mulberry shoots is used tosymbolize the way of making success certain. Confucius says about this line: <p> Danger arises when a man feels secure in his position. Destruction threatenswhen a man seeks to preserve his worldly estate. Confusion develops when a manhas put everything in order. Therefore the superior man does not forget dangerin his security, not ruin when he is well established, nor confusion when hisaffairs are in order. In this way he gains personal safety and is able toprotect the empire.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Nine at the top means: <p>The standstill comes to an end.  First standstill, then good fortune.<p> The standstill does not last forever. However, it does not cease of its ownaccord; the right man is needed to end it. This is the difference between astate of peace and a state of stagnation. Continuous effort is necessary tomaintain peace: left to itself it would change into stagnation anddisintegration. The time of disintegration, however, does not change backautomatically to a condition of peace and prosperity; effort must be put forthin order to end it. This shows the creative attitude that man must take if theworld is to be put in order.
