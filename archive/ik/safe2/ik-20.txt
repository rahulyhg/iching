20. Kuan / Contemplation (View)

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above SUN THE GENTLE, WIND  below K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH

</div><div class="explanation">
 A slight variation of tonal stress gives the Chinese name for this hexagrama double meaning. It means both contemplating and being seen, in the sense ofbeing an example. These ideas are suggested by the fact that the hexagram canbe understood as picturing a type of tower characteristic of ancient China.<p> A tower of this kind commanded a wide view of the country; at the same time,when situated on a mountain, it became a landmark that could be seen for milesaround. Thus the hexagram shows a ruler who contemplates the law of heavenabove him and the ways of the people below, and who, by means of goodgovernment, sets a lofty example to the masses. This hexagram is linked withthe eight month (September-October). The light-giving power retreats and thedark power is again on the increase. However, this aspect is not material inthe interpretation of the hexagram as a whole.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 CONTEMPLATION. The ablution has been made,  But not yet the offering.  Full of trust they look up to him.

</div><div class="explanation">
 The sacrificial ritual in China began with an ablution and a libation bywhich the Deity was invoked, after which the sacrifice was offered. The momentof time between these two ceremonies is the most sacred of all, the moment ofdeepest inner concentration. If piety is sincere and expressive of real faith,the contemplation of it has a transforming awe-spiring effect on those whowitness it. Thus also in nature a holy seriousness is to be seen in the factthat natural occurrences are uniformly subject to law. Contemplation of thedivine meaning underlying the workings of the universe gives to the man who iscalled upon to influence others the means of producing like effects. Thisrequires that power of inner concentration which religious contemplationdevelops in great men strong in faith. It enables them to apprehend themysterious and divine laws of life, and by means of profoundest innerconcentration they give expression to these laws in their own persons. Thus ahidden spiritual power emanates from them, influencing and dominating otherswithout their being aware of how it happens.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 The wind blows over the earth:  The image of CONTEMPLATION.  Thus the kings of old visited the regions of the world,  Contemplated the people,  And gave them instruction.

</div><div class="explanation">
 When the wind blows over the earth it goes far and wide, and the grass mustbend to its power. These two occurrences find confirmation in the hexagram.The two images are used to symbolize a practice of the kings of old; in makingregular journeys the ruler could, in the first place, survey his realm andmake certain that none of the existing usages of the people escaped notice; inthe second, he could exert influence through which such customs as wereunsuitable could be changed. All of this points to the power possessed by asuperior personality. On the one hand, such a man will have a view of the realsentiments of the great mass of humanity and therefore cannot be deceived; onthe other, he will impress the people so profoundly, by his mere existence andby the impact of his personality, that they will be swayed by him as the grassby the wind.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>Boy like contemplation.  For an inferior man, no blame.  For a superior man, humiliation.<p> This means contemplation from a distance, without comprehension. A man ofinfluence is at hand, abut his influence is not understood by the commonpeople. This matters little in the case of the masses, for they benefit by theactions of the ruling sage whether they understand them or not. But for asuperior man it is a disgrace. He must not content himself with a shallow,thoughtless view of prevailing forces; he must contemplate them as a connectedwhole and try to understand them.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>Contemplation through the crack of the door.  Furthering for the perseverance of a woman.<p> Through the crack of the door one has a limited outlook; one looks outwardfrom within. Contemplation is subjectively limited. One tends to relateeverything to oneself and cannot put oneself in another's place and understandhis motives. This is appropriate for a good housewife. It is not necessary forher to be conversant with the affairs of the world. But for a man who musttake active part in public life, such a narrow, egotistic way of contemplatingthings is of course harmful.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Six in the third place means: <p>Contemplation of my life  Decides the choice  Between advance and retreat.<p> This is the place of transition. We no longer look outward to receivepictures that are more or less limited and confused, but direct outcontemplation upon ourselves in order to find a guideline for our decisions.This self-contemplation means the overcoming of naive egotism in the personwho sees everything solely form his own standpoint. He begins to reflect andin this way acquires objectivity. However, self-knowledge does not meanpreoccupation with one's own thoughts; rather, it means concern about theeffects one creates. It is only the effects our lives produce that give us theright to judge whether what we have done means progress or regression.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>Contemplation of the light of the kingdom.  It furthers one to exert influence as the guest of a king.<p> This describes a man who understands the secrets by which a kingdom can bemade to flourish. Such a man must be given an authoritative position, in whichhe can exert influence. He should be, so to speak, a guest-that is, he shouldbe honored and act independently, and should not be used as a tool.  Nine at the top means: <p> Contemplation of his life.  The superior man is without blame.<p> While the preceding line represents a man who contemplates himself, here inthe highest place everything that is personal, related to the ego, isexcluded. The picture is that of a sage who stands outside the affairs of theworld. Liberated from his ego, he contemplates the laws of life and sorealizes that knowing how to become free of blame is the highest good.
