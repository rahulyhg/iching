    <div class="trigrams">
      above CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN below CH'IEN THE CREATIVE,
      HEAVEN
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The first hexagram is made up of six unbroken lines. These
      unbroken linesstand for the primal power, which is
      light-giving, active, strong, and of thespirit. The hexagram
      is consistently strong in character, and since it iswithout
      weakness, its essence is power or energy. Its image is
      heaven. Itsenergy is represented as unrestricted by any fixed
      conditions in space and istherefore conceived of as motion.
      Time is regarded as the basis of thismotion. Thus the
      hexagram includes also the power of time and the power
      ofpersisting in time, that is, duration. The power
      represented by the hexagramis to be interpreted in a dual
      sense in terms of its action on the universeand of its action
      on the world of men. In relation to the universe, thehexagram
      expresses the strong, creative action of the Deity. In
      relation tothe human world, it denotes the creative action of
      the holy man or sage, ofthe ruler or leader of men, who
      through his power awakens and develops theirhigher nature.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      THE CREATIVE works sublime success, Furthering through
      perseverance.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      According to the original meaning, the attributes [sublimity,
      potentialityof success, power to further, perseverance] are
      paired. When an individualdraws this oracle, it means that
      success will come to him from the primaldepths of the
      universe and that everything depends upon his seeking
      hishappiness and that of others in one way only, that is, by
      perseverance in whatis right. The specific meanings of the
      four attributes became the subject ofspeculation at an early
      date. The Chinese word here rendered by "sublime"means
      literally "head," "origin," "great." This is why Confucius
      says inexplaining it: "Great indeed is the generating power
      of the Creative; allbeings owe their beginning to it. This
      power permeates all heaven." For thisattribute inheres in the
      other three as well. The beginning of all things liesstill in
      the beyond in the form of ideas that have yet to become real.
      But theCreative furthermore has power to lend form to these
      archetypes of ideas. Thisis indicated in the word success,
      and the process is represented by an imagefrom nature: "The
      clouds pass and the rain does its work, and all
      individualbeings flow into their forms." Applies to the human
      world, these attributesshow the great man the way to notable
      success: "Because he sees with greatclarity and cause and
      effects, he completes the six steps at the right timeand
      mounts toward heaven on them at the right time, as though on
      six dragons."The six steps are the six different positions
      given in the hexagram, which arerepresented later by the
      dragon symbol. Here it is shown that the way tosuccess lies
      in apprehending and giving actuality to the way of the
      universe[Tao], which, as a law running through end and
      beginning, brings about allphenomena in time. Thus each step
      attained forthwith becomes a preparation forthe next. Time is
      no longer a hindrance but the means of making actual what
      ispotential. The act of creation having found expression in
      the two attributessublimity and success, the work of
      conservation is shown to be a continuousactualization and
      differentiation of form. This is expressed in the two
      terms"furthering" (literally, "creating that which accords
      with the nature of agiven being") and "persevering"
      (literally, "correct and firm"). "The courseof the Creative
      alters and shapes beings until each attains its true,
      specificnature, then it keeps them in conformity with the
      Great Harmony. Thus does itshow itself to further through
      perseverance." In relation to the human sphere,this shows how
      the great man brings peace and security to the world
      throughhis activity in creating order: "He towers high above
      the multitude of beings,and all lands are united in peace."
      Another line of speculation goes stillfurther in separating
      the words "sublime," "success," "furthering,""perseverance,"
      and parallels them with the four cardinal virtues in
      humanity.To sublimity, which, as the fundamental principle,
      embraces all the otherattributes, it links love. To the
      attribute success are linked the morals,which regulate and
      organize expressions of love and thereby make themsuccessful.
      The attribute furthering is correlated with justice, which
      createsthe conditions in which each receives that which
      accords with his being, thatwhich is due him and which
      constitutes his happiness. The attributeperseverance is
      correlated with wisdom, which discerns the immutable laws
      ofall that happens and can therefore bring about enduring
      conditions. Thesespeculations, already broached in the
      commentary called Wen Yen , later formedthe bridge connecting
      the philosophy of the "five stages (elements) ofchange," as
      laid down in the Book of History (Shu Ching) with the
      philosophyof the Book of Changes, which is based solely on
      the polarity of positive andnegative principles. In the
      course of time this combination of the two systemsof thought
      opened the way for an increasingly intricate number
      symbolism.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      The movement of heaven is full of power. Thus the superior
      man makes himself strong and untiring.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Since there is only one heaven, the doubling of the trigram
      Ch'ien, of whichheaven is the image, indicates the movement
      of heaven. One complete revolutionof heaven makes a day, and
      the repetition of the trigram means that each dayis followed
      by another. This creates the idea of time. Since it is the
      sameheaven moving with untiring power, there is also created
      the idea of durationboth in and beyond time, a movement that
      never stops nor slackens, just as oneday follows another in
      an unending course. This duration in time is the imageof the
      power inherent in the Creative. With this image as a model,
      the sagelearns how best to develop himself so that his
      influence may endure. He mustmake himself strong in every
      way, by consciously casting out all that isinferior and
      degrading. Thus he attains that tirelessness which depends
      uponconsciously limiting the fields of his activity.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>Hidden dragon. Do not act. In China the dragon has a
      meaning altogether different from that given it inthe Western
      world. The dragon is a symbol of the electrically
      charged,dynamic, arousing force that manifests itself in the
      thunderstorm. In winterthis energy withdraws into the earth;
      in the early summer it becomes activeagain, appearing in the
      sky as thunder and lightning. As a result the creativeforces
      on earth begin to stir again. Here this creative force is
      still hiddenbeneath the earth and therefore has no effect. In
      terms of human affairs, thissymbolizes a great man who is
      still unrecognized. Nonetheless he remains trueto himself. He
      does not allow himself to be influenced by outward success
      orfailure, but confident in his strength, he bides his time.
      Hence it is wisefor the man who consults the oracle and draws
      this line to wait in the calmstrength of patience. The time
      will fulfill itself. One need not fear leaststrong will
      should not prevail; the main thing is not to expend one's
      powersprematurely in an attempt to obtain by force something
      for which the time isnot yet ripe.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>Dragon appearing in the field. It furthers one to see the
      great man. Here the effects of the light-giving power begin
      to manifest themselves. Interms of human affairs, this means
      that the great man makes his appearance inhis chosen field of
      activity. As yet he has no commanding position but isstill
      with his peers. However, what distinguishes him form the
      others is hisseriousness of purpose, his unqualified
      reliability, and the influence heexerts on his environment
      with out conscious effort. Such a man is destined togain
      great influence and to set the world in order. Therefore it
      is favorableto see him.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Nine in the third place means:
      <p>All day long the superior man is creatively active. At
      nightfall his mind is still beset with cares. Danger. No
      blame. A sphere of influence opens up for the great man. His
      fame begins to spread.The masses flock to him. His inner
      power is adequate to the increased outeractivity. There are
      all sorts of things to be done, and when others are atrest in
      the evening, plans and anxieties press in upon him. But
      danger lurkshere at the place of transition from lowliness to
      the heights. Many a greatman has been ruined because the
      masses flocked to him and swept him into theircourse.
      Ambition has destroyed his integrity. However, true greatness
      is notimpaired by temptations. He who remains in touch with
      the time that isdawning, and with its demands is prudent
      enough to avoid all pitfalls, andremains blameless.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>Wavering flight over the depths. No blame. A place of
      transition has been reached, and free choice can enter in.
      Atwofold possibility is presented to the great man: he can
      soar to the heightsand play an important part in the world,
      or he can withdraw into solitude anddevelop himself. He can
      go the way of the hero or that of the holy sage whoseeks
      seclusion. There is no general law of his being. If the
      individual actsconsistently and is true to himself, he will
      find the way that is appropriatefor him. This way is right
      for him and without blame.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>Flying dragon in the heavens. It furthers one to see the
      great man. Here the great man has attained the sphere of the
      heavenly beings. Hisinfluence spreads and becomes visible
      throughout the whole world. Everyone whosees him may count
      himself blessed. Confucius says about this line: Things that
      accord in tone vibrate together. Things that have affinity
      intheir inmost natures seek one another. Water flows to what
      is wet, fire turnsto what is dry. Clouds (the breath of
      heaven) follow the dragon, wind (thebreath of earth) follows
      the tiger. Thus the sage arises, and all creaturesfollow him
      with their eyes. What is born of heaven feels related to what
      isabove. What is born of earth feels related to what is
      below. Each follows itskind.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Nine at the top means:
      <p>Arrogant dragon will have cause to repent. When a man
      seeks to climb so high that he loses touch with the rest
      ofmankind, he becomes isolated, and this necessarily leads to
      failure. This linewarns against titanic aspirations that
      exceed one's power. A precipitous fallwould follow. When all
      the lines are nines, it means: There appears a flight of
      dragons without heads. Good fortune. When all the lines are
      nines, it means that the whole hexagram is in motionand
      changes into the hexagram K'un, THE RECEPTIVE, whose
      character isdevotion. The strength of the Creative and the
      mildness of the Receptiveunite. Strength is indicated by the
      flight of dragons, mildness by the factthat their heads are
      hidden. This means that mildness in action joined tostrength
      of decision brings good fortune.</p>
