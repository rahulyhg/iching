      While in the hexagram Ta Kuo, PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT
      <p>28, the strong lines preponderate and are within, inclosed
      between weaklines at the top and bottom, the present hexagram
      has weak linespreponderating, though here again they are on
      the outside, the strong linesbeing within. This indeed is the
      basis of the exceptional situation indicatedby the hexagram.
      When strong lines are outside, we have the hexagram
      I,PROVIDING NOURISHMENT</p>
      <p>27, or Chung Fu, INNER TRUTH,</p>
      <p>61; neither represents and exceptional state. When strong
      elements withinpreponderate, they necessarily enforce their
      will. This creates struggle andexceptional conditions in
      general. But in the present hexagram it is the weakelement
      that perforce must mediate with the outside world. If a man
      occupies aposition of authority for which he is by nature
      really inadequate,extraordinary prudence is necessary.</p>

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      PREPONDERANCE OF THE SMALL. Success. Perseverance furthers.
      <p>Small things may be done; great things should not be
      done.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The flying bird brings the message: It is not well to strive
      upward, It is well to remain below. Great good fortune.
      <p>Exceptional modesty and conscientiousness are sure to be
      rewarded withsuccess; however, if a man is not to throw
      himself away, it is important thatthey should not become
      empty form and subservience but be combined always witha
      correct dignity in personal behavior. We must understand the
      demands of thetime in order to find the necessary offset for
      its deficiencies and damages.In any event we must not count
      on great success, since the requisite strengthis lacking. In
      this lies the importance of the message that one should
      notstrive after lofty things but hold to lowly things. The
      structure of thehexagram gives rise to the idea that this
      message is brought by a bird. In TaKuo, PREPONDERANCE OF THE
      GREAT</p>
      <p>28, the four strong, heavy lines within, supported only by
      two weak lineswithout, give the image of a sagging ridgepole.
      Here the supporting weak linesare both outside and
      preponderant; this gives the image of a soaring bird. Buta
      bird should not try to surpass itself and fly into the sun;
      it shoulddescend to the earth, where its nest is. In this way
      it gives the messageconveyed by the hexagram.</p>

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Thunder on the mountain: The image of PREPONDERANCE OF THE
      SMALL. Thus in his conduct the superior man gives
      preponderance to reverence. In bereavement he gives
      preponderance to grief. In his expenditures he gives
      preponderance to thrift.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Thunder on the mountain is different from thunder on the
      plain. In themountains, thunder seems much nearer; outside
      the mountains, it is lessaudible than the thunder of an
      ordinary storm. Thus the superior man derivesan imperative
      from this image: he must always fix his eyes more closely
      andmore directly on duty than does the ordinary man, even
      though this might makehis behavior seem petty to the outside
      world. He is exceptionallyconscientious in his actions. In
      bereavement emotion means more to him thanceremoniousness. In
      all his personal expenditures he is extremely simple
      andunpretentious. In comparison with the man of the masses,
      all this makes himstand out as exceptional. But the essential
      significance of his attitude liesin the fact that in external
      matters he is on the side of the lowly.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>The bird meets with misfortune through flying.</p>
      <p>A bird ought to remain in the nest until it is fledged. If
      it tries to flybefore this, it invites misfortune.
      Extraordinary measures should be resortedto only when all
      else fails. At first we ought to put up with traditional
      waysas long as possible; otherwise we exhaust ourselves and
      our energy and stillachieve nothing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Six in the second place means:
      <p>She passes by her ancestor And meets her ancestress. He
      does not reach his prince And meets the official.</p>
      <p>No blame.</p>
      <p>Two exceptional situations are instanced here. In the
      temple of ancestors,where alternation of generations
      prevails, the grandson stands on the sameside as the
      grandfather. Hence his closest relations are with the
      grandfather.The present line designates the grandson's wife,
      who during the sacrificepasses by the ancestor and goes
      toward the ancestress. This unusual behavioris, however, an
      expression of her modesty. She ventures rather to approach
      theancestress, for she feels related to her by their common
      sex. Hence heredeviation from the rule is not a mistake.
      Another image is that of theofficial who, in compliance with
      regulation, first seeks an audience with hisprince. If he is
      not successful in this, he does not try to force anything
      butgoes about conscientious fulfillment of his duty, taking
      his place among theother officials. This extraordinary
      restraint is likewise not a mistake inexceptional times. (The
      rule is that every official should first have anaudience with
      the prince by whom he is appointed. Here the appointment is
      madeby the minister.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Nine in the third place means:
      <p>If one is not extremely careful,</p>
      <p>Somebody may come up from behind and strike him.
      Misfortune.</p>
      <p>At certain times extraordinary caution is absolutely
      necessary. But it isjust in such life situations that we find
      upright and strong personalitieswho, conscious of being in
      the right, disdain to hold themselves on guard,because they
      consider it petty. Instead, they go their way proud
      andunconcerned. But this self-confidence deludes them. There
      are dangers lurkingfor which they are unprepared. Yet such
      danger is not unavoidable; one canescape it if he understands
      that the time demands that he pay especialattention to small
      and insignificant thing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>No blame. He meets him without passing by. Going brings
      danger. One must be on guard. Do not act. Be constantly
      persevering.</p>
      <p>Hardness of character is tempered by yielding position so
      that no mistakesare made. The situation here calls for
      extreme caution; one must make noattempt of one's own
      initiative to reach the desired end. And if one were togo on,
      endeavoring one must be on guard and not act but continue
      inwardly topersevere.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>Dense clouds,</p>
      <p>No rain from our western territory.</p>
      <p>The prince shoots and hits him who is in the cave.</p>
      <p>As a high place is pictured here, the image of a flying
      bird has become thatof flying clouds. But dense as the clouds
      are, they race across the sky andgive no rain. Similarly, in
      exceptional times there may be a born ruler who isqualified
      to set the world in order, but who cannot achieve anything or
      conferblessing on the people because he stands alone and has
      no helpers. Is suchtimes a man must seek out helpers with
      whose aid he can carry out the task.But these helpers must be
      modestly sought out in the retirement to which theyhave
      withdrawn. It is not in the fame nor their great names but
      their genuineachievements that are important. Through such
      modesty the right man is found,and the exceptional task is
      carried out in spite of all difficulties.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>He passes him by, not meeting him.</p>
      <p>The flying bird leaves him. Misfortune.</p>
      <p>This means bad luck and injury.</p>
      <p>If one overshoots the goal, one cannot hit it. If a bird
      will not come toits nest but flies higher and higher, it
      eventually falls into the hunter'snet. He who in times of
      extraordinary salience of small things does not knowhow to
      call a halt, but restlessly seeks to press on and on, draws
      uponhimself misfortune at the hands of gods and men, because
      he deviates from theorder of nature.</p>
