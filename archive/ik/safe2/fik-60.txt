      60. Chieh / Limitation
    </div>
    <div class="trigrams">
      above K'AN THE ABYSMAL, WATER below TUI THE JOYOUS, LAKE
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      A lake occupies a limited space. When more water comes into
      it, itoverflows. Therefore limits must be set for the water.
      The image shows waterbelow and water above, with the
      firmament between them as a limit. The Chineseword for
      limitation really denotes the joints that divide a bamboo
      stalk. Inrelation to ordinary life it means the thrift that
      sets fixed limits uponexpenditures. In relation to the moral
      sphere it means the fixed limits thatthe superior man sets
      upon his actions-the limits of loyalty anddisinterestedness.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      LIMITATION. Success. Galling limitation must not be
      persevered in.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Limitations are troublesome, but they are effective. If we
      live economicallyin normal times, we are prepared for times
      of want. To be sparing saves usfrom humiliation. Limitations
      are also indispensable in the regulation ofworld conditions.
      In nature there are fixed limits for summer and winter,
      dayand night, and these limits give the year its meaning. In
      the same way,economy, by setting fixed limits upon
      expenditures, acts to preserve propertyand prevent injury to
      the people. But in limitation we must observe duemeasure. If
      a man should seek to impose galling limitations upon his
      ownnature, it would be injurious. And if he should go too far
      in imposinglimitations on others, they would rebel. Therefore
      it is necessary to setlimits even upon limitation.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Water over lake: the image of LIMITATION. Thus the superior
      man Creates number and measure, And examines the nature of
      virtue and correct conduct.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      A lake is something limited. Water is inexhaustible. A lake
      can contain onlya definite amount of the infinite quantity of
      water; this is its peculiarity.In human life too the
      individual achieves significance through discriminationand
      the setting of limits. Therefore what concerns us here is the
      problem ofclearly defining these discriminations, which are,
      so to speak, the backboneof morality. Unlimited possibilities
      are not suited to man; if they existed,his life would only
      dissolve in the boundless. To become strong, a man's
      lifeneeds the limitations ordained by duty and voluntarily
      accepted. Theindividual attains significance as a free spirit
      only by surrounding himselfwith these limitations and by
      determining for himself what his duty is.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>Not going out of the door and the courtyard Is without
      blame.</p>
      <p>Often a man who would like to undertake something finds
      himself confrontedby insurmountable limitations. Then he must
      know where to stop. If he rightlyunderstands this and does
      not go beyond the limits set for him, he accumulatesan energy
      that enables him, when the proper time comes, to act with
      greatforce. Discretion is of prime importance in preparing
      the way for momentousthings. Concerning this, Confucius
      says:</p>
      <p>Where disorder develops, words are the first steps. If the
      prince is notdiscreet, he loses his servant. If the servant
      is not discreet he loses hislife. If germinating things are
      not handled with discretion, the perfecting ofthem is
      impeded. Therefore the superior man is careful to maintain
      silence anddoes not go forth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>Not going out of the gate and the courtyard Brings
      misfortune.</p>
      <p>When the time for action has come, the moment must be
      quickly seized. Justas water first collects in a lake without
      flowing out, yet is certain to findan outlet when the lake is
      full, so it is in the life of man. It is a goodthing to
      hesitate so long as the time for action has not come, but no
      longer.Once the obstacles to action have been removed,
      anxious hesitation is amistake that is bound to bring
      disaster, because one misses one's opportunity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>He who knows limitation Will have cause to lament.</p>
      <p>No blame.</p>
      <p>If an individual is bent only on pleasures and enjoyment,
      it is easy for himto lose his sense of the limits that are
      necessary. If he gives himself overto extravagance, he will
      have to suffer the consequences, with accompanyingregret. He
      must not seek to lay the blame on others. Only when we
      realize thatour mistakes are of our own making will such
      disagreeable experiences free usof errors.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Six in the fourth place means:
      <p>Contented limitation. Success.</p>
      <p>Every limitation has its value, but a limitation that
      requires persistenteffort entails a cost of too much energy.
      When, however, the limitation is anatural one (as for
      example, the limitation by which water flows onlydownhill),
      it necessarily leads to success, for then it means a saving
      ofenergy. The energy that otherwise would be consumed in a
      vain struggle withthe object, is applied wholly to the
      benefit of the matter in hand, andsuccess is assured.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>Sweet limitation brings good fortune. Going brings
      esteem.</p>
      <p>The limitation must be carried out in the right way if it
      is to beeffective. If we seek to impose restrictions on
      others only, while evadingthem ourselves, these restrictions
      will always be resented and will provokeresistance. If,
      however, a man in a leading position applies the
      limitationfirst to himself, demanding little from those
      associated with him, and withmodest means manages to achieve
      something, good fortune is the result. Wheresuch an example
      occurs, it meets with emulation, so that whatever
      isundertaken must succeed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>Galling limitation. Perseverance brings misfortune.
      Remorse disappears.</p>
      <p>If one is too severe in setting up restrictions, people
      will not endurethem. The more consistent such severity, the
      worse it is, for in the long runa reaction is unavoidable. In
      the same way, the tormented body will rebelagainst excessive
      asceticism. On the other hand, although ruthless severity
      isnot to be applied persistently and systematically, there
      may be times when itsi the only means of safeguarding against
      guilt and remorse. In suchsituations ruthlessness toward
      oneself is the only means of saving one's soul,which
      otherwise would succumb to irresolution and temptation.</p>
