7. Shih / The Army

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH  below K'AN THE ABYSMAL, WATER

</div><div class="explanation">
 This hexagram is made up of the trigrams K'an, water, and K'un, earth, andthus it symbolizes the ground water stored up in the earth. In the same waymilitary strength is stored up in the mass of the people--invisible in timesof peace but always ready for use as a source of power. The attributes of thetwo trig rams are danger inside and obedience must prevail outside. Of theindividual lines, the one that controls the hexagram is the strong nine in thesecond place, to which the other lines, all yielding, are subordinate. Thisline indicates a commander, because it stands in the middle of one of the twotrigrams. But since it is in the lower rather than the upper trigram, itrepresents not the ruler but the efficient general, who maintains obedience inthe army by his authority.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 THE ARMY. The army needs perseverance  And a strong man.  Good fortune without blame.

</div><div class="explanation">
 An army is a mass that needs organization in order to become a fightingforce.  Without strict discipline nothing can be accomplished, but this disciplinemust not be achieved by force. It requires a strong man who captures thehearts of the people and awakens their enthusiasm. In order that he maydevelop his abilities he needs the complete confidence of his ruler, who mustentrust him with full responsibility as long as the war lasts. But war isalways a dangerous thing and brings with it destruction and devastation.Therefore it should not be resorted to rashly but, like a poisonous drug,should be used as a last recourse.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 In the middle of the earth is water:  The image of THE ARMY. Thus the superior man increases his masses  By generosity toward the people.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Ground water is invisibly present within the earth. In the same way themilitary power of a people is invisibly present in the masses. When dangerthreatens, every peasant becomes present in the masses. When danger threatens,every peasant becomes a soldier; when the war ends, he goes back to his plow.He who is generous toward the people wins their love, and a people livingunder a mild rule becomes strong and powerful. Only a people economicallystrong can be important in military power. Such power must therefore becultivated by improving the economic condition of the people and by humanegovernment. Only when there is this invisible bond between government andpeople, so that the people are sheltered by their government as ground wateris sheltered by the earth, is it possible to wage a victorious war.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>An army must set forth in proper order.  If the order is not good, misfortune threatens.<p> At the beginning of a military enterprise, order is imperative. A just andvalid cause must exist, and the obedience and coordination of the troops mustbe well organized, otherwise the result is inevitably failure.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Nine in the second place means: <p>In the midst of the army.  Good fortune. No blame.  The king bestows a triple decoration.<p> The leader should be in the midst of his army, in touch with it, sharinggood and bad with the masses he leads. This alone makes him equal to the heavydemands made upon him. He needs also the recognition of the ruler. Thedecorations he receives are justified, because there is no question ofpersonal preferment here: the whole army, whose center he is, is honored inhis person.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Six in the third place means: <p>Perchance the army carries corpses in the wagon.  Misfortune.<p> Here we have a choice of two explanations. One points to defeat becausesomeone other than the chosen leader interferes with the command; the other issimilar in its general meaning, but the expression, "carries corpses in thewagon," is interpreted differently. At burials and at sacrifices to the deadit was customary in China for the deceased to whom the sacrifice was made tobe represented by a boy of the family, who sat in the dead man's place and washonored as his representative. On the basis of this custom the text isinterpreted as meaning that a "corpse boy" is sitting in the wagon, or, inother words, that authority is not being exercised by the proper leaders buthas been usurped by others. Perhaps the whole difficulty clears up if it isinferred that there has been an error in copying. The character fan, meaning"all," may have been misread as shih, which means "corpse." Allowing for thiserror, the meaning would be that if the multitude assumes leadership of thearmy (rides in the wagon), misfortune will ensue.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>The army retreats. No blame.<p> In the face of a superior enemy, with whom it would be hopeless to engage inbattle, an orderly retreat is the only correct procedure, because it will savethe army from defeat and disintegration. It is by no means a sign of courageor strength to insist upon engaging in a hopeless struggle regardless ofcircumstances. 

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Six in the fifth place means: <p>There is game in the field.  It furthers one to catch it.  Without blame.  Let the eldest lead the army.  The younger transports corpses;  Then perseverance brings misfortune.<p> Game is in the field--it has left its usual haunts in the forest and isdevastating the fields. This points to an enemy invasion. Energetic combat andpunishment are here thoroughly justified, but they must not degenerate into awild melee in which everyone fends for himself. Despite the greatest degree ofperseverance and bravery, this would lead to misfortune. The army must bedirected by an experienced leader. It is a matter of waging war, not ofpermitting the mob to slaughter all who fall into their hands; if they do,defeat will be the result, and despite all perseverance there is danger ofmisfortune.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Six at the top means: <p>The great prince issues commands,  Founds states, vests families with fiefs.  Inferior people should not be employed.<p> The war has ended successfully, victory is won, and the king divided estatesand fiefs among his faithful vassals. But it is important that inferior peopleshould not come into power. If they have helped, let them be paid off withmoney, but they should not be awarded lands or the privileges of rulers, lestpower be abused.
