      31. Hsien / Influence (Wooing)
    </div>
    <div class="trigrams">
      above TUI THE JOYOUS, LAKE below KeN KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The name of the hexagram means "universal," "general," and in
      a figurativesense "to influence," "to stimulate." The upper
      trigram is Tui, the Joyous;the lower is Ken, Keeping still.
      By its persistent, quiet influence, thelower, rigid trigram
      stimulates the upper, weak trigram, which responds tothis
      stimulation cheerfully and joyously. Ken, the lower trigram,
      is theyoungest son; the upper, Tui, is the youngest daughter.
      Thus the universalmutual attraction between the sexes is
      represented. In courtship, themasculine principle must seize
      the initiative and place itself below thefeminine principle.
      Just as the first part of book 1 begins with the hexagramsof
      heaven and earth, the foundations of all that exists, the
      second partbegins with the hexagrams of courtship and
      marriage, the foundations of allsocial relationships.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Influence. Success. Perseverance furthers.
      <p>To take a maiden to wife brings good fortune.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The weak element is above, the strong below; hence their
      powers attract eachother, so that they unite. This brings
      about success, for all success dependson the effect of mutual
      attraction. By keeping still within while experiencingjoy
      without, one can prevent the joy from going to excess and
      hold it withinproper bounds. This is the meaning of the added
      admonition, "Perseverancefurthers," for it is perseverance
      that makes the difference between seductionand courtship; in
      the latter the strong man takes a position inferior to thatof
      the weak girl and shows consideration for her. This
      attraction betweenaffinities is a general law of nature.
      Heaven and earth attract each other andthus all creatures
      come into being. Through such attraction the sageinfluences
      men's hearts, and thus the world attains peace. From
      theattractions they exert we can learn the nature of all
      beings in heaven and onearth.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      A lake on the mountain: The image of influence. Thus the
      superior man encourages people to approach him By his
      readiness to receive them.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      A mountain with a lake on its summit is stimulated by the
      moisture from thelake. It has this advantage because its
      summit does not jut out as a peak butis sunken. The image
      counsels that the mind should be kept humble and free, sothat
      it may remain receptive to good advice. People soon give up
      counseling aman who thinks that he knows everything better
      than anyone else.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>The influence shows itself in the big toe.</p>
      <p>A movement, before it is actually carried out, shows
      itself first in thetoes. The idea of an influence is already
      present, but is not immediatelyapparent to others. As long as
      the intention has no visible effect, it is ofno importance to
      the outside world and leads neither to good nor to evil.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Six in the second place means:
      <p>The influence shows itself in the calves of the legs.
      Misfortune.</p>
      <p>Tarrying brings good fortune.</p>
      <p>In movement, the calf of the leg follows the foot; by
      itself it can neithergo forward nor stand still. Since the
      movement is not self-governed, it bodesill. One should wait
      quietly until one is impelled to action by a realinfluence.
      Then one remains uninjured.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Nine in the third place means:
      <p>The influence shows itself in the thighs. Holds to that
      which follows it.</p>
      <p>To continue is humiliating.</p>
      <p>Every mood of the heart influences us to movement. What
      the heart desires,the thighs run after without a moment's
      hesitation; they hold to the heart,which they follow. In the
      life of man, however, acting on the spur of everycaprice is
      wrong and if continued leads to humiliation. Three
      considerationssuggest themselves here. First, a man should
      not run precipitately after allthe persons whom he would like
      to influence, but must be able to hold backunder certain
      circumstances. As little should he yield immediately to
      everywhim of those in whose service he stands. Finally, where
      the moods of his ownheart are concerned, he should never
      ignore the possibility of inhibition, forthis is the basis of
      human freedom.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>Perseverance brings good fortune. Remorse disappears. If a
      man is agitated in mind, And his thoughts go hither and
      thither, Only those friends On whom he fixes his conscious
      thoughts Will follow.</p>
      <p>Here the place of the heart is reached. The impulse that
      springs from thissource is the most important of all. It is
      of particular concern that thisinfluence be constant and
      good; then, in spite of the danger arising from thegreat
      susceptibility of the human heart, there will be no cause for
      remorse.When the quiet power of a man's own character is at
      work, the effects producedare right. All those who are
      receptive to the vibrations of such a spirit willthen be
      influenced. Influence over others should not express itself
      as aconscious and willed effort to manipulate them. Through
      practicing suchconscious incitement, one becomes wrought up
      and is exhausted by the eternalstress and strain. Moreover,
      the effects produced are then limited to those onwhom one's
      thoughts are consciously fixed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>The influence shows itself in the back of the neck.</p>
      <p>No remorse.</p>
      <p>The back of the neck is the most rigid part of the body.
      When the influenceshows itself there, the will remains firm
      and the influence does not lead toconfusion. Hence remorse
      does not enter into consideration here. What takesplace in
      the depths of one's being, in the unconscious mind. It is
      true thatif we cannot be influenced ourselves, we cannot
      influence the outside world.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>The influence shows itself in the jaws, cheeks, and
      tongue.</p>
      <p>The most superficial way of trying to influence others is
      through talk thathas nothing real behind it. The influence
      produced by such mere tongue waggingmust necessarily remain
      insignificant. Hence no indication is added regardinggood or
      bad fortune.</p>
