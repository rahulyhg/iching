21. Shih Ho / Biting Through

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above LI THE CLINGING, FIRE  below CHeN THE AROUSING, THUNDER

</div><div class="explanation">
 This hexagram represents an open mouth (cf. hexagram<p> 27 with an obstruction (in the fourth place) between the teeth. As a resultthe lips cannot meet. To bring them together one must bite energeticallythrough the obstacle. Since the hexagram is made up of the trigrams forthunder and for lightning, it indicates how obstacles are forcibly removed innature.  Energetic biting through overcomes the obstacle that prevents joining of thelips; the storm with its thunder and lightning overcomes the disturbingtension in nature. Recourse to law and penalties overcomes the disturbances ofharmonious social life caused by criminals and slanderers. The theme of thishexagram is a criminal lawsuit, in contradistinction to that of Sung, CONFLICT<p> 6, which refers to civil suits.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 BITING THROUGH has success.  It is favorable to let justice be administered.

</div><div class="explanation">
 When an obstacle to union arises, energetic biting through brings success.This is true in all situations. Whenever unity cannot be established, theobstruction is due to a talebearer and traitor who is interfering and blockingthe way. To prevent permanent injury, vigorous measures must be taken at once.Deliberate obstruction of this sort does not vanish of its own accord.Judgment and punishment are required to deter or obviate it. However, it isimportant to proceed in the right way. The hexagram combines Li, clarity, andChen, excitement. Li is yielding, Chen is hard. Unqualified hardness andexcitement would be too violent in meting out punishment; unqualified clarityand gentleness would be too weak. The two together create the just measure. Itis of moment that the man who makes the decisions (represented by the fifthline) is gentle by nature, while he commands respect by his conduct in hisposition.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Thunder and lighting:  The image of BITING THROUGH.  Thus the kings of former times made firm the laws  Through clearly defined penalties.  

</div><div class="explanation">
 Penalties are the individual applications of the law. The lawsspecify thepenalties. Clarity prevails when mild and severepenalties are differentiated,according to the nature of the crimes.This is symbolized by the clarity oflighting. The law is strengthenedby a just application of penalties. This issymbolized by the terrorof thunder. This clarity and severity have the effectof instillingrespect; it is not that the penalties are ends in themselves.Theobstructions in the social life of man increase when there is alack of clarityin the penal codes and slackness in executing them.The only to strengthen thelaw is to make it clear and make penaltiescertain and swift.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Nine at the beginning means: <p>His feet are fastened in the stocks,  So that his toes disappear.  No blame.<p> If a sentence is imposed the first time a man attempts to do wrong, thepenalty is a mild one. Only the toes are put in the stocks. This prevents himfrom sinning further and thus he becomes free of blame. It is a warning tohalt in time on the path of evil.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>Bites through tender meat,  So that his nose disappears.  No blame.<p> It is easy to discriminate between right and wrong in this case;it is likebiting through tender meat. But one encounters ahardened sinner, and, arousedby anger, one goes a little toofar. The disappearance of the nose in thecourse of the bitesignifies that indignation blots out finer sensibility.However,there is no great harm in this, because the penalty as such isjust.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Six in the third place means: <p>Bites on old dried meat  And strikes on something poisonous.  Slight humiliation. No blame.<p> Punishment is to be carried out by someone who lacks the power and authorityto do so. Therefore the culprits do not submit. The matter at issue is an oldone-as symbolized by salted game-and in dealing with it difficulties arise.This old meat is spoiled: by taking up the problem the punisher arousespoisonous hatred against himself, and n this way is put in a somewhathumiliating position. But since punishment was required by the time, heremains free of blame.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Nine in the fourth place means: <p>Bites on dried gristly meat.  Receives metal arrows.  It furthers one to be mindful of difficulties  And to be persevering.  Good fortune.<p> There are great obstacles to be overcome, powerful opponents are to bepunished. Though this is arduous, the effort succeeds. But it is necessary tobe hard as metal and straight as an arrow to surmount the difficulties. If oneknows these difficulties and remains persevering, he attains good fortune. Thedifficult task is achieved in the end. 

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Six in the fifth place means: <p>Bites on dried lean meat.  Receives yellow gold.  Perseveringly aware of danger.<p> No blame.<p> The case to be decided is indeed not easy but perfectly clear. Since wenaturally incline to leniency, we must make every effort to be like yellowgold-that is, as true as gold and as impartial as yellow, the color of themiddle [the mean]. It is only by remaining conscious of the dangers growingout of the responsibility we have assumed that we can avoid making mistakes.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Nine at the top means: <p>His neck is fastened in the wooden cangue,  So that his ears disappear.  Misfortune.<p> In contrast to the first line, this line refers to a man who isincorrigible. His punishment is the wooden cangue, and his ears disappearunder it-that is to say, he is deaf to warnings. This obstinacy leads tomisfortune.
