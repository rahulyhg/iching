28. Ta Kuo / Preponderance of the Great

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above TUI THE JOYOUS, LAKE  below SUN THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD

</div><div class="explanation">
 This hexagram consists of four strong lines inside and two weak linesoutside. When the strong are outside and the weak inside, all is well andthere is nothing out of balance, nothing extraordinary in the situation. Here,however, the opposite is the case. The hexagram represents a beam that isthick and heavy in the middle but too weak at the ends. This is a conditionthat cannot last; it must be changed, must pass, or misfortune will result.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT.<p> The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.  It furthers one to have somewhere to go.<p> Success.

</div><div class="explanation">
 The weight of the great is excessive. The load is too heavy for the strengthof the supports. The ridgepole on which the whole roof rests, sags to thebreaking point, because its supporting ends are too weak for the load theybear. It is an exceptional time and situation; therefore extraordinarymeasures are demanded. It is necessary to find a way of transition as quicklyas possible, and to take action. This promises success. For although thestrong element is in excess, it is in the middle, that is, at the center ofgravity, so that a revolution is not to be feared. Nothing is to be achievedby forcible measures. The problem must be solved by gently penetration to themeaning of the situation (as is suggested by the attribute of the innertrigram, Sun); then the change-over to other conditions will be successful. Itdemands real superiority; therefore the time when the great preponderates is amomentous time.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 The lake rises above the trees: The image of PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT.Thus the superior man, when he stands alone,  Is unconcerned,  And if he has to renounce the world,  He is undaunted.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Extraordinary times when the great preponderates are like flood times whenthe lake rises over the treetops. But such conditions are temporary. The twotrigrams indicate the attitude proper to such exceptional times: the symbol ofthe trigram Sun is the tree, which stands firm even though it stands alone,and the attribute of Tui is joyousness, which remains undaunted even if itmust renounce the world.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>To spread white rushes underneath.<p> No blame.<p> When a man wishes to undertake an enterprise in extraordinary times, he mustbe extraordinarily cautious, just as when setting a heavy thing down on thefloor, one takes care to put rushes under it, so that nothing will break. Thiscaution, though it may seem exaggerated, is not a mistake. Exceptionalenterprises cannot succeed unless utmost caution is observed in theirbeginnings and in the laying of their foundations. 

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Nine in the second place means: <p>A dry poplar sprouts at the root.  An older man takes a young wife.  Everything furthers.<p> Wood is near water; hence the image of an old poplar sprouting at the root.This means an extraordinary situation arises when an older man marries a younggirl who suits him. Despite the unusualness of the situation, all goes well.From the point of view of politics, the meaning is that in exceptional timesone does well to join with the lowly, for this affords a possibility ofrenewal.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.  Misfortune.  <p> This indicates a type of man who in times of preponderance of the greatinsists on pushing ahead. He accepts no advice from others, and therefore theyin turn are not willing to lend him support. Because of this the burden grows,until the structure of things bends or breaks. Plunging willfully ahead intimes of danger only hastens the catastrophe. 

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Nine in the fourth place means: <p>The ridgepole is braced. Good fortune.  If there are ulterior motives, it is humiliating.<p> Through friendly relations with people of lower rank, a responsible mansucceeds in becoming master of the situation. But if, instead of working forthe rescue of the whole, he were to misuse his connections to obtain personalpower and success, it would lead to humiliation.

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Nine in the fifth place means: <p>A withered poplar puts forth flowers.  An older woman takes a husband.<p> No blame. No praise.<p> A withered poplar that flowers exhausts its energies thereby and onlyhastens its end. An older woman may marry once more, but no renewal takesplace. Everything remains barren. Thus, though all the amenities are observed,the net result is only the anomaly of the situation. Applied to politics, themetaphor means that if in times of insecurity we give up alliance with thosebelow us and keep up only the relationships we have with people of higherrank, an unstable situation is created.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Six at the top means: <p>One must go through the water.  It goes over one's head.  Misfortune. No blame.<p> Here is a situation in which the unusual has reached a climax. One iscourageous and wishes to accomplish one's task, no matter what happens. Thisleads into danger. The water rises over one's head. This is the misfortune.But one incurs no blame in giving up one's life that the good and the rightmay prevail. There are things that are more important than life.
