46. Sheng / Pushing Upward

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH  below SUN THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD

</div><div class="explanation">
 The lower trigram, Sun, represents wood, and the upper, K'un, means theearth. Linked with this is the idea that wood in the earth grows upward. Incontrast to the meaning of Chin, PROGRESS<p> 35, this pushing upward is associated with effort, just as a plant needsenergy for pushing upward through the earth. That is why this hexagram,although it is connected with success, is associated with effort of the will.In PROGRESS the emphasis is on expansion; PUSHING UPWARD indicates rather avertical ascent-direct rise from obscurity and lowliness to power andinfluence.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 PUSHING UPWARD has supreme success.  One must see the great man.  Fear not.  Departure toward the south  Brings good fortune.

</div><div class="explanation">
 The pushing upward of the good elements encounters no obstruction and istherefore accompanied by great success. The pushing upward is made possiblenot by violence but by modesty and adaptability. Since the individual is bornealong by the propitiousness of the time, he advances. He must go to seeauthoritative people. He need not be afraid to do this, because success isassured. But he must set to work, for activity (this is the meaning of "thesouth") brings good fortune.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Within the earth, wood grows:  The image of PUSHING UPWARD. Thus the superior man of devoted character  Heaps up small things  In order to achieve something high and great.

</div><div class="explanation">

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>Pushing upward that meets with confidence  Brings great good fortune.<p> This situation at the beginning of ascent. Just as wood draws strength forits upward push from the root, which in itself is in the lowest place, so thepower to rise comes from this low and obscure station. But there is aspiritual affinity with the rulers above, and this solidarity creates theconfidence needed to accomplish something.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Nine in the second place means: <p>If one is sincere,  It furthers one to bring even a small offering.<p> No blame.<p> Here a strong man is presupposed. It is true that he does not fit in withhis environment, inasmuch as he is too brusque and pays too little attentionto form. But as he is upright in character, he meets with response, and hislack of outward form does no harm. Here uprightness is the outcome of soundqualities of character, whereas in the corresponding line of the precedinghexagram it is the result of innate humility.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>One pushes upward into an empty city.  <p> All obstructions that generally block progress fall away here. Thingsproceed with remarkable ease. Unhesitatingly one follows this road, in orderto profit by one's success. Seen from without, everything seems to be in thebest of order. However, no promise of good fortune is added. It is a questionhow long such unobstructed success can last. But it is wise not to yield tosuch misgivings, because they only inhibit one's power. Instead, the point isto profit by the propitiousness of time.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>The king offers him Mount Ch'i.  Good fortune. No blame.<p> Mount Ch'i is in the western China, the homeland of King Wen, whose son, theDuke of Chou, added the words to the individual lines. The pronouncement takesus back to a time when the Chou dynasty was coming into power. At that timeKing Wen introduced his illustrious helpers to the god of his native mountain,and they received their places in the halls of the ancestors by the side ofthe ruler. This indicates a stage in which pushing upward attains its goal.One acquires fame in the sight of gods and men, is received into the circle ofthose who foster the spiritual life of the nation, and thereby attains asignificance that endures beyond time.

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Six in the fifth place means: <p>Perseverance brings good fortune.  One pushes upward by steps.<p> When a man is advancing farther and farther, it is important for him not tobecome intoxicated by success. Precisely when he experiences great success itis necessary to remain sober and not to try to skip any stages; he must go onslowly, step by step, as though hesitant. Only such calm, steady progress,overleaping nothing, leads to the goal.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Six at the top means: <p>Pushing upward in darkness.  It furthers one<p> To be unremittingly persevering.<p> He who pushes upward blindly deludes himself. He knows only advance, notretreat. But this means exhaustion. In such a case it is important to beconstantly mindful that one must be conscientious and consistent and mustremain so. Only thus does one become free of blind impulse, which is alwaysharmful.
