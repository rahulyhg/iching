34. Ta Chuang / The Power of the Great

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above CHeN THE AROUSING, THUNDER  below CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN

</div><div class="explanation">
 The great lines, that is, the light, strong lines, are powerful. Four lightlines have entered the hexagram from below and are about to ascend higher. Theupper trigram is Chen, the Arousing; the lower is ch'ien, the Creative. Ch'ienis strong, Chen produces movement. The union of movement and strength givesthe meaning of THE POWER OF THE GREAT. The hexagram is linked with the secondmonth (March-April).

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 THE POWER OF THE GREAT. Perseverance furthers.

</div><div class="explanation">
 The hexagram points to a time when inner worth mounts with great force andcomes to power. But its strength has already passed beyond the median line,hence there is danger that one may rely entirely on one's own power and forgetto ask what is right. There is danger too that, being intent on movement, wemay not wait for the right time. Therefore the added statement thatperseverance furthers. For that is truly great power which does not degenerateinto mere force but remains inwardly united with the fundamental principles ofright and of justice. When we understand this point--namely, that greatnessand justice must be indissolubly united--we understand the true meaning of allthat happens in heaven and on earth.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Thunder in heaven above: The image of THE POWER OF THE GREAT. Thus the superior man does not tread upon paths

</div><div class="explanation">
 That do not accord with established order.<p> Thunder--electrical energy--mounts upward in the spring. The direction ofthis movement is in harmony with that of the movement of heaven. It istherefore a movement in accord with heaven, producing great power. However,true greatness depends on being in harmony with what is right. Therefore intimes of great power the superior man avoids doing anything that is not inharmony with the established order.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Nine at the beginning means: <p>Power in the toes.  Continuing brings misfortune.<p> This is certainly true.<p> The toes are in the lowest place and are ready to advance. So likewise greatpower in lowly station is inclined to effect advance by force. This, ifcarried further, would certainly lead to misfortune, and therefore by way ofadvice a warning is added.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Nine in the second place means: <p>Perseverance brings good fortune.<p> The premise here is that the gates to success are beginning to open.Resistance gives way and we forge ahead. This is the point at which, only tooeasily, we become the prey of exuberant self-confidence. This is why theoracle says that perseverance (i.e., perseverance in inner equilibrium,without excessive use of power) brings good fortune.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>The inferior man works through power.<p> The superior man does not act thus.<p> To continue is dangerous.  A goat butts against a hedge  And gets its horns entangled.<p> Making a boast of power leads to entanglements, just as a goat entangles itshorns when it butts against a hedge. Whereas an inferior man revels in powerwhen he comes into possession of it, the superior man never makes thismistake. He is conscious at all times of the danger of pushing aheadregardless of circumstances, and therefore renounces in good time the emptydisplay of force. 

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Nine in the fourth place means: <p>Perseverance brings good fortune.  Remorse disappears.<p> The hedge opens; there is no entanglement.  Power depends upon the axle of a big cart.<p> If a man goes on quietly and perseveringly working at the removal ofresistances, success comes in the end. The obstructions give way and alloccasion for remorse arising from excessive use of power disappears.<p> Such a man's power does not show externally, yet it can move heavy loads,like a big cart whose real strength lies in its axle. The less that power isapplied outwardly, the greater its effect.

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Six in the fifth place means: <p>Loses the goat with ease.<p> No remorse.<p> The goat is noted for hardness outwardly and weakness within. Now thesituation is such that everything is easy; there is no more resistance. Onecan give up a belligerent, stubborn way of acting and will not have to regretit.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Six at the top means: <p>A goat butts against a hedge.  It cannot go backward, it cannot go forward.<p> Nothing serves to further.  If one notes the difficulty, this brings good fortune.<p> If we venture too far we come to a deadlock, unable either to advance or toretreat and whatever we do merely serves to complicate thing further. Suchobstinacy leads to insuperable difficulties. But if, realizing the situation,we compose ourselves and decide not to continue, everything will right itselfin time.
