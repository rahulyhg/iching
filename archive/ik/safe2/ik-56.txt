56. Lu / The Wanderer

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above LI THE CLINGING, FIRE  below KeN KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN

</div><div class="explanation">
 the mountain, Ken, stands still; above it fire, Li, flames up and does nottarry. Therefore the two trigrams do not stay together. Strange lands andseparation are the wanderer's lot. When a man is a wanderer and stranger, heshould not be gruff nor overbearing. He has no large circle of acquaintances,therefore he should not give himself airs. He must be cautious and reserved;in this way he protects himself from evil. If he is obliging toward others, hewins success. A wanderer has no fixed abode; his home is the road. Thereforehe must take care to remain upright and steadfast, so that he sojourns only inthe proper places, associating only with good people. Then he has good fortuneand can go his way unmolested.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Fire on the mountain:  The image of THE WANDERER. Thus the superior man  Is clear-minded and cautious  In imposing penalties,  And protracts no lawsuits.

</div><div class="explanation">
 When grass on a mountain takes fire, there is bright light. However, thefire does not linger in one place, but travels on to new fuel. It is aphenomenon of short duration. This is what penalties and lawsuits should belike. They should be a quickly passing matter, and must not be dragged outindefinitely. Prisons ought to be places where people are lodged onlytemporarily, as guests are. They must not become dwelling places.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>If the wanderer busies himself with trivial things,  He draws down misfortune upon himself.<p> A wanderer should not demean himself or busy himself with inferior things hemeets with along the way. The humbler and more defenseless his outwardposition, the more should he preserve his inner dignity. For a stranger ismistaken if he hopes to find a friendly reception through lending himself tojokes and buffoonery. The result will be only contempt and insultingtreatment.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>The wanderer comes to an inn.  He has his property with him.  He wins the steadfastness of a young servant.  <p> The wanderer her described is modest and reserved. He does not lose touchwith his inner being, hence he finds a resting place. In the outside world hedoes not lose the liking of other people, hence all persons further him, sothat he can acquire property. Moreover, he wins the allegiance of a faithfuland trustworthy servant-a thing of inestimable value to a wanderer.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>The wanderer's inn burns down.  He loses the steadfastness of his young servant.  Danger.<p> A truculent stranger does not know how to behave properly. He meddles inaffairs and controversies that do not concern him; thus he loses his restingplace. He treats his servant with aloofness and arrogance; thus he loses theman's loyalty. When a stranger in a strange land has no one left on whom hecan rely, the situation becomes very dangerous.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Nine in the fourth place means: <p>The wanderer rests in a shelter.  He obtains his property and an ax.  My heart is not glad.<p> This describes a wanderer who knows how to limit his desires outwardly,though he is inwardly strong and aspiring. Therefore he finds at least a placeof shelter in which he can stay. He also succeeds in acquiring property, buteven with this he is not secure. He must be always on guard, ready to defendhimself with arms. Hence he is not at ease. He is persistently conscious ofbeing a stranger in a strange land. 

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Six in the fifth place means: <p>He shoots a pheasant.  It drops with the first arrow.  In the end this brings both praise and office.<p> Traveling statesman were in the habit of introducing themselves to localprinces with the gift of a pheasant, killing it at the first shot. Thus hefinds friends who praise and recommend him, and in the end the prince acceptshim and confers an office upon him. Circumstances often cause a man to seek ahome in foreign parts. If he knows how to meet the situation and how tointroduce himself in the right way, he may find a circle of friends and asphere of activity even in a strange country.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Nine at the top means: <p>The bird's nest burns up.<p> The wanderer laughs at first,<p> Then must needs lament and weep.<p> Through carelessness he loses his cow.  Misfortune.<p> The picture of a bird whose nest burns up indicates loss of one's restingplace. This misfortune may overtake the bird if it is heedless and imprudentwhen building its nest. It is the same with a wanderer. If he lets himself go,laughing and jesting, and forgets that he is a wanderer, he will later havecause to weep and lament. For if through carelessness a man loses hiscow-i.e., his modesty and adaptability-evil will result.
