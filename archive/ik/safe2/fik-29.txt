      29. K'an / The Abysmal (Water)
    </div>
    <div class="trigrams">
      above K'AN THE ABYSMAL, WATER below K'AN THE ABYSMAL, WATER
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      This hexagram consists of a doubling of the trigram K'an. It
      is one of theeight hexagrams in which doubling occurs. The
      trigram K'an means a plungingin. A yang line has plunged in
      between two yin lines and is closed in by themlike water in a
      ravine. The trigram K'an is also the middle son. The
      Receptivehas obtained the middle line of the Creative, and
      thus K'an develops. As animage it represents water, the water
      that comes from above and is in motion onearth in streams and
      rivers, giving rise to all life on earth. In man's worldK'an
      represents the heart, the soul locked up within the body, the
      principleof light inclosed in the dark--that is, reason. The
      name of the hexagram,because the trigram is doubled, has the
      additional meaning, "repetition ofdanger." Thus the hexagram
      is intended to designate an objective situation towhich one
      must become accustomed, not a subjective attitude. For danger
      due toa subjective attitude means either foolhardiness or
      guile. Hence too a ravineis used to symbolize danger; it is a
      situation in which a man is in the samepass as the water in a
      ravine, and, like the water, he can escape if hebehaves
      correctly.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      The Abysmal repeated. If you are sincere, you have success in
      your heart, And whatever you do succeeds.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Through repetition of danger we grow accustomed to it. Water
      sets theexample for the right conduct under such
      circumstances. It flows on and on,and merely fills up all the
      places through which it flows; it does not shrinkfrom any
      dangerous spot nor from any plunge, and nothing can make it
      lose itsown essential nature. It remains true to itself under
      all conditions. Thuslikewise, if one is sincere when
      confronted with difficulties, the heart canpenetrate the
      meaning of the situation. And once we have gained inner
      masteryof a problem, it will come about naturally that the
      action we take willsucceed. In danger all that counts is
      really carrying out all that has to bedone--thoroughness--and
      going forward, in order not to perish through tarryingin the
      danger. Properly used, danger can have an important meaning
      as aprotective measure. Thus heaven has its perilous height
      protecting it againstevery attempt at invasion, and earth has
      its mountains and bodies of water,separating countries by
      their dangers. Thus also rulers make use of danger toprotect
      themselves against attacks from without and against turmoil
      within.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Water flows on uninterruptedly and reaches its foal: The
      image of the Abysmal repeated. Thus the superior man walks in
      lasting virtue And carries on the business of teaching.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Water reaches its goal by flowing continually. It fills up
      every depressionbefore it flows on. The superior man follows
      its example; he is concerned thatgoodness should be an
      established attribute of character rather than anaccidental
      and isolated occurrence. So likewise in teaching others
      everythingdepends on consistency, for it is only through
      repetition that the pupil makesthe material his own.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>Repetition of the Abysmal. In the abyss one falls into a
      pit. Misfortune.</p>
      <p>By growing used to what is dangerous, a man can easily
      allow it to becomepart of him. He is familiar with it and
      grows used to evil. With this he haslost the right way, and
      misfortune is the natural result.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>The abyss is dangerous. One should strive to attain small
      things only.</p>
      <p>When we are in danger we ought not to attempt to get out
      of it immediately,regardless of circumstances; at first we
      must content ourselves with not beingovercome by it. We must
      calmly weigh the conditions of the time and bysatisfied with
      small gains, because for the time being a great success
      cannotbe attained. A spring flows only sparingly at first,
      and tarries for some timebefore it makes its way in to the
      open.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>Forward and backward, abyss on abyss. In danger like this,
      pause at first and wait, Otherwise you will fall into a pit
      in the abyss. Do not act this way.</p>
      <p>Here every step, forward or backward, leads into danger.
      Escape is out ofthe question. Therefore we must not be misled
      into action, as a result ofwhich we should only bog down
      deeper in the danger; disagreeable as it may beto remain in
      such a situation, we must wait until a way out shows
      itself.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Six in the fourth place means:
      <p>A jug of wine, a bowl of rice with it; Earthen vessels</p>
      <p>Simply handed in through the Window.</p>
      <p>There is certainly no blame in this.</p>
      <p>In times of danger ceremonious forms are dropped. What
      matters most issincerity. Although as a rule it is customary
      for an official to presentcertain introductory gifts and
      recommendations before he is appointed, hereeverything is
      simplified to the utmost. The gifts are insignificant, there
      isno one to sponsor him, he introduces himself; yet all this
      need not behumiliating if only there is the honest intention
      of mutual help in danger.Still another idea is suggested. The
      window is the place through which lightenters the room. If in
      difficult times we want to enlighten someone, we mustbegin
      with that which is in itself lucid and proceed quite simply
      from thatpoint on.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>The abyss is not filled to overflowing, It is filled only
      to the rim.</p>
      <p>No blame.</p>
      <p>Danger comes because one is too ambitious. In order to
      flow out of a ravine,water does not rise higher than the
      lowest point of the rim. So likewise a manwhen in danger has
      only to proceed along the line of least resistance; thus
      hereaches the goal. Great labors cannot be accomplished in
      such times; it isenough to get out of the danger.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>Bound with cords and ropes,</p>
      <p>Shut in between thorn-hedged prison walls: For three years
      one does not find the way. Misfortune.</p>
      <p>A man who in the extremity of danger has lost the right
      way and isirremediably entangled in his sins has no prospect
      of escape. He is like acriminal who sits shackled behind
      thorn hedged prison walls.</p>
