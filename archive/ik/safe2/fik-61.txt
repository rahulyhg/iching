      61. Chung Fu / Inner Truth
    </div>
    <div class="trigrams">
      above SUN THE GENTLE, WIND below TUI THE JOYOUS, LAKE
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The wind blows over the lake and stirs the surface of the
      water. Thusvisible effects of the invisible manifest
      themselves. The hexagram consists offirm lines above and
      below, while it is open in the center. This indicates aheart
      free of prejudices and therefore open to truth. On the other
      hand, eachof the two trigrams has a firm line in the middle;
      this indicates the force ofinner truth in the influences they
      present. The attributes of the two trigramsare: above,
      gentleness, forbearance toward inferiors; below, joyousness
      inobeying superiors. Such conditions create the basis of a
      mutual confidencethat makes achievements possible. The
      character of fu ("truth") is actuallythe picture of a bird's
      foot over a fledgling. It suggests the idea ofbrooding. An
      egg is hollow. The light-giving power must work to quicken
      itfrom outside, but there must be a germ of life within, if
      life is to beawakened. Far-reaching speculations can be
      linked with these ideas.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      INNER TRUTH. Pigs and fishes. Good fortune. It furthers one
      to cross the great water. Perseverance furthers.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Pigs and fishes are the least intelligent of all animals and
      therefore themost difficult to influence. The force of inner
      truth must grow great indeedbefore its influence can extend
      to such creatures. In dealing with persons asintractable and
      as difficult to influence as a pig or a fish, the whole
      secretof success depends on finding the right way of
      approach. One must first ridoneself of all prejudice and, so
      to speak, let the psyche of the other personact on one
      without restraint. Then one will establish contact with
      him,understand and gain power over him. When a door has thus
      been opened, theforce of one's personality will influence
      him. If in this way one finds noobstacles insurmountable, one
      can undertake even the most dangerous things,such as crossing
      the great water, and succeed. But it is important
      tounderstand upon what the force inner truth depends. This
      force is notidentical with simple intimacy or a secret bond.
      Close ties may exist alsoamong thieves; it is true that such
      a bond acts as a force but, since it isnot invincible, it
      does not bring good fortune. All association on the basisof
      common interests holds only up to a certain point. Where the
      community ofinterest ceases, the holding together ceases
      also, and the closest friendshipoften changes into hate. Only
      when the bond is based on what is right, onsteadfastness,
      will it remain so firm that it triumphs over everything.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Wind over lake: the image of INNER TRUTH. Thus the superior
      man discusses criminal cases In order to delay executions.
      <p>Wind stirs water by penetrating it. Thus the superior man,
      when obliged tojudge the mistakes of men, tries to penetrate
      their minds with understanding,in order to gain a sympathetic
      appreciation of the circumstances.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      In ancient China, the entire administration of justice was
      guided by this principle. Adeep understanding that knows how
      to pardon was considered the highest form ofjustice. This
      system was not without success, for its aim was to make
      sostrong a moral impression that there was no reason to fear
      abuse of suchmildness. For it sprang not from weakness but
      from a superior clarity.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>Being prepared brings good fortune. If there are secret
      designs, it is disquieting.</p>
      <p>The force of inner truth depends chiefly on inner
      stability andpreparedness. From this state of mind springs
      the correct attitude toward theouter world. But if a man
      should try to cultivate secret relationships of aspecial
      sort, it would deprive him of his inner independence. The
      morereliance he places on the support of others, the more
      uneasy and anxious hewill become as to whether these secret
      ties are really tenable. In this wayinner peace and the force
      of inner truth are lost.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>A crane calling in the shade. Its young answers it. I have
      a good goblet. I will share it with you.</p>
      <p>This refers to the involuntary influence of a man's inner
      being upon personsof kindred spirit. The crane need not show
      itself on a high hill. It may bequite hidden when it sounds
      its call; yet its young will hear its not, willrecognize it
      and give answer. Where there is a joyous mood, there a
      comradewill appear to share a glass of wine. This is the echo
      awakened in men throughspiritual attraction. Whenever a
      feeling is voiced with truth and frankness,whenever a deed is
      the clear expression of sentiment, a mysterious and
      far-reaching influence is exerted. At first it acts on those
      who are inwardlyreceptive. But the circle grows larger and
      larger. The root of all influencelies in one's own inner
      being: given true and vigorous expression in word anddeed,
      its effect is great. The effect is but the reflection of
      something thatemanates from one's own heart. Any deliberate
      intention of an effect wouldonly destroy the possibility of
      producing it. Confucius says about this line:</p>
      <p>The superior man abides in his room. If his words are well
      spoken, he meetswith assent at a distance of more than a
      thousand miles. How much more thenfrom near by! If the
      superior man abides in his room and his words are notwell
      spoken, he meets with contradiction at a distance of more
      than a thousandmiles. How much more then from near by! Words
      go forth from one's own personand exert their influence on
      men. Deeds are born close at hand and becomevisible far away.
      Words and deeds are the hinge and bowspring of the
      superiorman. As hinge and bowspring move, they bring honor or
      disgrace. Through wordsand deeds the superior man moves
      heaven and earth . Must one not, then, becautious?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>He finds a comrade.</p>
      <p>Now he beats the drum, now he stops.</p>
      <p>Now he sobs, now he sings.</p>
      <p>Here the source of a man's strength lies not in himself
      but in his relationto other people. No matter how close to
      them he may be, if his center ofgravity depends on them, he
      is inevitably tossed to and fro between joy andsorrow.
      Rejoicing to high heaven, then sad unto death-this is the
      fate ofthose who depend upon an inner accord with other
      persons whom they love. Herewe have only the statement of the
      law that this is so. Whether this conditionis felt to be an
      affliction of the supreme happiness of love, is left to
      thesubjective verdict of the person concerned.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Six in the fourth place means:
      <p>The moon nearly at the full.</p>
      <p>The team horse goes astray.</p>
      <p>No blame.</p>
      <p>To intensify the power of inner truth, a man must always
      turn to hissuperior, from whom he can receive enlightenment
      as the moon receives lightform the sun. However, this
      requires a certain humility, like that of the moonwhen it is
      not yet quite full. At the moment when the moon becomes full
      andstands directly opposite the sun, it begins to wane. Just
      as on the one handwe must be humble and reverent when face to
      face with the source ofenlightenment, so likewise must we on
      the other renounce factionalism amongmen. Only be pursuing
      one's course like a horse that goes straight aheadwithout
      looking sidewise at its mate, can one retain the inner
      freedom thathelps one onward.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>He possesses truth, which links together.</p>
      <p>No blame.</p>
      <p>This describes the ruler who holds all elements together
      by the power of hispersonality. Only when the strength of his
      character is so ample that he caninfluence all who are
      subject to him, is he as he needs to be. The power
      ofsuggestion must emanate from the ruler. It will firmly knit
      together and uniteall his adherents. Without this central
      force, all external unity is onlydeception and breaks down at
      the decisive moment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Nine at the top means:
      <p>Cockcrow penetrating to heaven. Perseverance brings
      misfortune.</p>
      <p>The cock is dependable. It crows at dawn. But it cannot
      itself fly toheaven. It just crows. A man may count on mere
      words to awaken faith. This maysucceed now and then, but if
      persisted in, it will have bad consequences.</p>
