      57. Sun / The Gentle (The Penetrating, Wind)

      Sun is one of the eight doubled trigrams. It is the eldest
      daughter andsymbolizes wind or wood; it has for its attribute
      gentleness, whichnonetheless penetrates like the wind or like
      growing wood with its roots. Thedark principle, in itself
      rigid and immovable, is dissolved by the penetratinglight
      principle, to which it subordinates itself in gentleness. In
      nature, itis the wind that disperses the gathered clouds,
      leaving the sky clear andserene. In human life it is
      penetrating clarity of judgment that thwarts alldark hidden
      motives. In the life of the community it is the powerful
      influenceof a great personality that uncovers and breaks up
      those intrigues which shunthe light of day.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      THE GENTLE. Success through what is small. It furthers one to
      have somewhere to go. It furthers one to see the great man.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Penetration produces gradual and inconspicuous effects. It
      should beeffected not by an act of violation but by influence
      that never lapses.Results of this kind are less striking to
      the eye than those won by surpriseattack, but they are more
      enduring and more complete. If one would producesuch effects,
      one must have a clearly defined goal, for only when
      thepenetrating influence works always in the same direction
      can the object beattained. Small strength can achieve its
      purpose only by subordinating itselfto an eminent man who is
      capable of creating order.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Winds following one upon the other: The image of THE GENTLY
      PENETRATING. Thus the superior man
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Spreads his commands abroad And carries out his undertakings.
      <p>The penetrating quality of the wind depends upon its
      ceaselessness. This iswhat makes it so powerful; time is its
      instrument. In the same way the ruler'sthought should
      penetrate the soul of the people. This too requires a
      lastinginfluence brought about by enlightenment and command.
      Only when the commandhas been assimilated by the people is
      action in accordance with it possible.Action without
      preparation of the ground only frightens and repels.</p>

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>In advancing and in retreating,</p>
      <p>The perseverance of a warrior furthers.</p>
      <p>In born gentleness is often carried to the point of
      indecisiveness. One doesnot feel strong enough to advance
      resolutely. A thousand doubts crop up; oneis, however, not
      minded to withdraw but drifts indecisively to and fro. Insuch
      a situation, a military decisiveness is the proper thing, so
      that oneresolutely does what order demands. Resolute
      discipline is far better thanirresolute license.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>Penetration under the bed. Priests and magicians are used
      in great number. Good fortune. No blame.</p>
      <p>At times one has to deal with hidden enemies, intangible
      influences thatslink into dark corners and from this hiding
      affect people by suggestion. Ininstances like this, it is
      necessary to trace these things back to the mostsecret
      recesses, in order to determine the nature of the influences
      to bedealt with. This is the task of the priests; removing
      the influences is thetask of the magicians. The very
      anonymity of such plotting requires anespecially vigorous and
      indefatigable effort, but this is well worth while.For when
      such elusive influences are brought into the light and
      branded, theylose their power over people.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Nine in the third place means:
      <p>Repeated penetration. Humiliation.</p>
      <p>Penetrating reflection must not be pushed too far, lest it
      cripple the powerof decision. After a matter has been
      thoroughly pondered, it is essential toform a decision and to
      act. Repeated deliberation brings fresh doubts andscruples,
      and thereby humiliation, because one shows oneself unable to
      act.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Six in the fourth place means:
      <p>Remorse vanishes. During the hunt</p>
      <p>Three kinds of game are caught.</p>
      <p>When a responsible position and accumulated experience
      lead one to combineinnate modesty with energetic action,
      great success is assured. The threekinds of animals referred
      to served for offerings to the gods, for feastingguests, and
      for everyday consumption. When the catch answered all
      threepurposes, the hunt was considered especially
      successful.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>Perseverance brings good fortune. Remorse vanishes.</p>
      <p>Nothing that does not further.</p>
      <p>No beginning, but an end. Before the change, three days.
      After the change, three days. Good fortune.</p>
      <p>In the situation described in Ku, WORK ON WHAT HAS BEEN
      SPOILED</p>
      <p>18, an entirely new point of departure must be set up,
      whereas here it isonly a question of reforms. The beginning
      has not been good, but the momenthas been reached when a new
      direction can be taken. Change and improvement arecalled for.
      Such steps must be undertaken with steadfastness, that is,
      with afirm and correct attitude of mind; then they will
      succeed, and remorse willdisappear. But it must be remembered
      that such improvements require carefulconsideration. Before a
      change is made, it must be pondered over again andagain.
      After the change is made, it is necessary to note carefully
      for sometime after how the improvements bear the test of
      actuality. Such careful workis accompanied by good
      fortune.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Nine at the top means:
      <p>Penetration under the bed. He loses his property and his
      ax. Perseverance brings misfortune.</p>
      <p>A man's understanding is sufficiently penetrating. He
      follows up injuriousinfluences into the most secret corners.
      But he no longer has the strength tocombat them decisively.
      In this case any attempt to penetrate into thepersonal domain
      of darkness would only bring harm.</p>
