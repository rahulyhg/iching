      The hexagram pictures a dangerous abyss lying before us and a
      steep,inaccessible mountain rising behind us. We are
      surrounded by obstacles; at thesame time, since the mountain
      has the attribute of keeping still, there isimplicit a hint
      as to how we can extricate ourselves. The hexagram
      representsobstructions that appear in the course of time but
      that can and should beovercome. Therefore all the instruction
      given is directed to overcoming them.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      OBSTRUCTION. The southwest furthers.
      <p>The northeast does not further. It furthers one to see the
      great man. Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The southwest is the region of retreat, the northeast that of
      advance. Herean individual is confronted by obstacles that
      cannot be overcome directly. Insuch a situation it is wise to
      pause in view of the danger and to retreat.However, this is
      merely a preparation for overcoming the obstructions. Onemust
      join forces with friends of like mind and put himself under
      theleadership of a man equal to the situation: then one will
      succeed in removingthe obstacles. This requires the will to
      persevere just when one apparentlymust do something that
      leads away from his goal. This unswerving inner purposebrings
      good fortune in the end. An obstruction that lasts only for a
      time isuseful for self-development. This is the value of
      adversity.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Water on the mountain: The image of OBSTRUCTION. Thus the
      superior man turns his attention to himself And molds his
      character.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Difficulties and obstructions throw a man back upon himself.
      While theinferior man seeks to put the blame on other
      persons, bewailing his fate, thesuperior man seeks the error
      within himself, and through this introspectionthe external
      obstacle becomes for him an occasion for inner enrichment
      andeducation.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>Going leads to obstructions, Coming meets with praise.</p>
      <p>When one encounters an obstruction, the important thing is
      to reflect on howbest to deal with it. When threatened with
      danger, one should not striveblindly to go ahead, for this
      only leads to complications. The correct thingis, on the
      contrary, to retreat for the time being, not in order to give
      upthe struggle but to await the right moment for action.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Six in the second place means:
      <p>The King's servant is beset by obstruction upon
      obstruction, But it is not his own fault.</p>
      <p>Ordinarily it is best to go around an obstacle and try to
      overcome it alongthe line of least resistance. But there is
      one instance in which a man must goout to meet the trouble,
      even though difficulty piles upon difficulty: this iswhen the
      path of duty leads directly to it-in other words, when he
      cannot actof his own volition but is duty bound to go and
      seek out danger in the serviceof a higher cause. Then he may
      do it without compunction, because it is notthrough any fault
      of his that he is putting himself in this
      difficultsituation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Nine in the third place means:
      <p>Going leads to obstructions; Hence he comes back.</p>
      <p>While the preceding line shows the official compelled by
      duty to follow theway of danger, this line shows the man who
      must act as father of a family oras head of his kin. If he
      were to plunge recklessly in to danger, it would bea useless
      act, because those entrusted to his care cannot get along
      bythemselves. But if he withdraws and turns back to his own,
      they welcome himwith great joy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Six in the fourth place means:
      <p>Going leads to obstructions, Coming leads to union.</p>
      <p>This too describes a situation that cannot be managed
      single-handed. In sucha case the direct way is not the
      shortest. If a person were to forge ahead onhis own strength
      and without the necessary preparations, he would not find
      thesupport he needs and would realize too late that he has
      been mistaken in hiscalculations, inasmuch as the conditions
      on which he hoped he could rely wouldprove to be inadequate.
      In this case it is better, therefore, to hold back forthe
      time being and to gather together trustworthy companions who
      can becounted upon for help in overcoming the
      obstructions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>In the midst of the greatest obstructions, Friends
      come.</p>
      <p>Here we see a man who is called to help in an emergency.
      He should not seekto evade the obstructions, no matter how
      dangerously they pile up before him.But because he is really
      called to the task, the power of his spirit is strongenough
      to attract helpers whom he can effectively organize, so that
      throughthe well-directed co-operation of all participants the
      obstruction isovercome.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>Going leads to obstructions, Coming leads to great good
      fortune. It furthers one to see the great man.</p>
      <p>This refers to a man who has already left the world and
      its tumult behindhim. When the time of obstructions arrives,
      it might seem that the simplestthing for him to do would be
      to turn his back upon the world and take refugein the beyond.
      But this road is barred to him. He must not seek his
      ownsalvation and abandon the world to its adversity. Duty
      calls him back oncemore into the turmoil of life. Precisely
      because of his experience and innerfreedom, he is able to
      create something both great and complete that bringsgood
      fortune. And it is favorable to see the great man in alliance
      with whomone can achieve the work of rescue.</p>
