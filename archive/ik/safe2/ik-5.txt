5. Hsu / Waiting (Nourishment)

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above K'AN THE ABYSMAL, WATER  below CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN

</div><div class="explanation">
 All beings have need of nourishment from above. But the gift of food comesin its own time, and for this one must wait. This hexagram shows the clouds inthe heavens, giving rain to refresh all that grows and to provide mankind withfood and drink. The rain will come in its own time. We cannot make it come; wehave to wait for it. The idea of waiting is further suggested by theattributes of the two trigrams--strength within, danger in from. Strength inthe face of danger does not plunge ahead but bides its time, whereas weaknessin the face of danger grows agitated and has not the patience to wait.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 WAITING. If you are sincere,  You have light and success.  Perseverance brings good fortune.  It furthers one to cross the great water.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Waiting is not mere empty hoping. It has the inner certainty of reaching thegoal. Such certainty alone gives that light which leads to success. This leadsto the perseverance that brings good fortune and bestows power to cross thegreat water. One is faced with a danger that has to be overcome. Weakness andimpatience can do nothing. Only a strong man can stand up to his fate, for hisinner security enables him to endure to the end. This strength shows itself inuncompromising truthfulness [with himself]. It is only when we have thecourage to face things exactly as they are, without any sort of self-deceptionor illusion, that a light will develop out of events, by which the path tosuccess may be recognized. This recognition must be followed by resolute andpersevering action. For only the man who goes to meet his fate resolutely isequipped to deal with it adequately. Then he will be able to cross the greatwater--that is to say, he will be capable of making the necessary decision andof surmounting the danger.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Clouds rise up to heaven:  The image of WAITING.  Thus the superior man eats and drinks,  Is joyous and of good cheer.

</div><div class="explanation">
 When clouds rise in the sky, it is a sign that it will rain. There is nothing to do but to wait until after the rain falls. It is the same in lifewhen destiny is at work. We should not worry and seek to shape the future byinterfering in things before the time is ripe. We should quietly fortify thebody with food and drink and the mind with gladness and good cheer. Fate comeswhen it will, and thus we are ready.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Nine at the beginning means: <p>Waiting in the meadow.  IT furthers one to abide in what endures.  No blame.<p> The danger is not yet close. One is still waiting on the open plain.Conditions are still simple, yet there is a feeling of something impending.One must continue to lead a regular life as long as possible. Only in this waydoes one guard against a premature waste of strength, keep free of blame anderror that would become a source of weakness later on.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Nine in the second place means: <p>Waiting on the sand.  There is some gossip.  The end brings good fortune.<p> The danger gradually comes closer. Sand is near the bank of the river, andthe water means danger. Disagreements crop up. General unrest can easilydevelop in such times, and we lay the blame on one another. He who stays calmwill succeed in making things go well in the end. Slander will be silenced ifwe do not gratify it with injured retorts.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>Waiting in the mud  Brings about the arrival of the enemy.<p> Mud is no place for waiting, since it is already being washed by the waterof the stream. Instead of having gathered strength to cross the stream at onetry, one has made a premature start that has got him no farther than the muddybank. Such an unfavorable position invites enemies from without, who naturallytake advantage of it. Caution and a sense of the seriousness of the situationare all that can keep one from injury.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>Waiting in blood.  Get out of the pit.<p> The situation is extremely dangerous. IT is of utmost gravity now--a matterof life and death. Bloodshed seems imminent. There is no going forward orbackward; we are cut off as if in a pit. Now we must simply stand fast and letfate take its course. This composure, which keeps us from aggravating thetrouble by anything we might do, is the only way of getting out of thedangerous pit.  

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Nine in the fifth place means: <p>Waiting at meat and drink.  Perseverance brings good fortune.<p> Even in the midst of danger there come intervals of peace when things gorelatively well. If we possess enough inner strength, we shall take advantageof these intervals to fortify ourselves for renewed struggle. We must know howto enjoy the moment without being deflected from the goal, for perseverance isneeded to remain victorious. This is true in public life as well; it is notpossible to achieve everything all at once. The height of wisdom is to allowpeople enough recreation to quicken pleasure in their work until the task iscompleted. Herein lies the secret of the whole hexagram. It differs from ChinOBSTRUCTION<p> 39, in the fact that in this instance, while waiting, we are sure of ourcause and therefore do not lose the serenity born of inner cheerfulness.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Six at the top means: <p>One falls into the pit.  Three uninvited guests arrive.  Honor them, and in the end there will be good fortune.  <p> The waiting is over; the danger can no longer be averted. One falls into thepit and must yield to the inevitable. Everything seems to have been in vain.But precisely in this extremity things take an unforeseen turn. Without a moveon one's own part, there is outside intervention. At first one cannot be sureof its meaning: is it rescue or is it destruction? A person in this situationmust keep his mind alert and not withdraw into himself with a sulky gesture ofrefusal, but must greet the new turn with respect. Thus he ultimately escapesthe danger, and all goes well. Even happy turns of fortune often come in aform that at first seems strange to us.
