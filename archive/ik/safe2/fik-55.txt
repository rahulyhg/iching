    <div class="explanation">
      Chen is movement; Li is flame, whose attribute is clarity.
      Clarity within,movement without-this produces greatness and
      abundance. The hexagram picturesa period of advanced
      civilization. However, the fact that development hasreached a
      peak suggests that this extraordinary condition of abundance
      cannotbe maintained permanently.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      ABUNDANCE has success.
      <p>The king attains abundance. Be not sad. Be like the sun at
      midday.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      It is not given to every mortal to bring about a time of
      outstandinggreatness and abundance. Only a born ruler of men
      is able to do it, becausehis will is directed to what is
      great. Such a time of abundance is usuallybrief. Therefore a
      sage might well feel sad in view of the decline that
      mustfollow. But such sadness foes not befit him. Only a man
      who is inwardly freeof sorrow and care can lead in a time of
      abundance. He must be like the sun atmidday, illuminating and
      gladdening everything under heaven.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Both thunder and lightning come: The image of ABUNDANCE. Thus
      the superior man decides lawsuits And carries out
      punishments.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      This hexagram has a certain connection with Shih Ho, BITING
      THROUGH
      <p>21, in which thunder and lightning similarly appear
      together, but in thereverse order. In BITING THROUGH, laws
      are laid down; here they are appliedand enforced. Clarity
      [Li] within makes it possible to investigate the
      factsexactly, and shock [Chen] without ensures a strict and
      precise carrying out ofpunishments.</p>

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>When a man meets his destined ruler,</p>
      <p>They can be together ten days, And it is not a mistake.
      Going meets with recognition.</p>
      <p>To bring about a time of abundance, a union of clarity
      with energeticmovement is needed. Two individuals possessed
      of these two attributes aresuited to each other, and even if
      they spend an entire cycle of time togetherduring the period
      of abundance, it will not be too long, nor is it a
      mistake.Therefore one may go forth, in order to make one's
      influence felt; it willmeet with recognition.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Six in the second place means:
      <p>The curtain is of such fullness</p>
      <p>That the polestars can be seen at noon.</p>
      <p>Through going one meets with mistrust and hate. If one
      rouses him through truth, Good fortune comes.</p>
      <p>It often happens that plots and party intrigues, which
      have the darkeningeffect of an eclipse of the sun, come
      between a ruler intent on greatachievement and the man who
      could effect great undertakings. Then, instead ofthe sun, we
      see the northern stars in the sky. The ruler is overshadowed
      by aparty that has usurped power. If a man at such a time
      were to try to takeenergetic measures, he would encounter
      only mistrust and envy, which wouldprohibit all movement. The
      essential thing then is to hold inwardly to thepower of
      truth, which in the end is so strong that it exerts an
      invisibleinfluence on the ruler, so that all goes well.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Nine in the third place means:
      <p>The underbrush is of such abundance</p>
      <p>That the small stars can be seen at noon. He breaks his
      right arm . No blame.</p>
      <p>The image is that of a progressive covering over of the
      sun. Here theeclipse reaches totality, therefore even the
      small stars can be seen at noon.In the sphere of social
      relationships, this means that the prince is now soeclipsed
      that even the most insignificant persons can push themselves
      into theforeground. This makes it impossible for an able man,
      though he might be theright hand of the ruler, to undertake
      anything. It is as though his arm werebroken, but he is not
      to blame for being thus hindered in action.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>The curtain is of such fullness</p>
      <p>That the polestars can be seen at noon. He meets his
      ruler, who is of like kind. Good fortune.</p>
      <p>Here the darkness is already decreasing, therefore
      interrelated elementscome together. Here too the complement
      must be found-the necessary wisdom tocomplement joy of
      action. Then everything will go well. The complementaryfactor
      postulated here is the reverse of the one in the first line.
      In thelatter, wisdom is to be complemented by energy, while
      here energy iscomplemented by wisdom.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>Lines are coming, Blessing and fame draw near. Good
      fortune.</p>
      <p>The ruler is modest and therefore open to the counsel of
      able men. Thus heis surrounded by men who suggest to him the
      lines of action. This bringsblessing, fame, and good fortune
      to him and all the people.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>His house is in a state of abundance. He screens off his
      family. He peers through the gate And no longer perceives
      anyone. For three years he sees nothing. Misfortune.</p>
      <p>This describes a man who because of his arrogance and
      obstinacy attains theopposite of what he strives for. He
      seeks abundance and splendor for hisdwelling. He wishes at
      all odds to be master in his house, which so alienateshis
      family that in the end he finds himself completely
      isolated.</p>
