      The lake is above, water below; the lake is empty, dried up.
      Exhaustion isexpressed in yet another way: at the top, a dark
      line is holding down twolight line; below, a light line is
      hemmed in between two dark ones. The uppertrigram belongs to
      the principle of darkness, the lower to the principle
      oflight. Thus everywhere superior men are oppressed and held
      in restraint byinferior men.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      OPPRESSION. Success. Perseverance.
      <p>The great man brings about good fortune.</p>
      <p>No blame. When one has something to say, It is not
      believed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Times of adversity are the reverse of times of success, but
      they can lead tosuccess if they; befall the right man. When a
      strong man meets with adversity,he remains cheerful despite
      all danger, and this cheerfulness is the source oflater
      successes; it is that stability which is stronger than fate.
      He who letshis spirit be broken by exhaustion certainly has
      no success. But if adversityonly bends a man, it creates in
      him a power to react that is bound in time tomanifest itself.
      No inferior man is capable of this. Only the great man
      bringsabout goof fortune and remains blameless. It is true
      that for the time beingoutward influence is denied him,
      because his words have no effect. Thereforein times of
      adversity it is important to be strong within and sparing
      ofwords.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      There is not water in the lake: The image of EXHAUSTION. Thus
      the superior man stakes his life On following his will.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      When the water has flowed out below, the lake must dry up and
      becomeexhausted. That is fate. This symbolizes an adverse
      fate in human life. Insuch times there is nothing a man can
      do but acquiesce in his fate and remaintrue to himself. This
      concerns the deepest stratum of his being, for thisalone is
      superior to all external fate.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>One sits oppressed under a bare tree And strays into a
      gloomy valley. For three years one sees nothing.</p>
      <p>When adversity befalls a man, it is important above all
      things for him to bestrong and to overcome the trouble
      inwardly. If he is weak, the troubleoverwhelms him. Instead
      of proceeding on his way, he remains sitting under abare tree
      and falls ever more deeply into gloom and melancholy. This
      makes thesituation only more and more hopeless. Such an
      attitude comes from an innerdelusion that he must by all
      means overcome.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>One is oppressed while at meat and drink.</p>
      <p>The man with the scarlet knee bands is just coming. It
      furthers one to offer sacrifice.</p>
      <p>To set forth brings misfortune.</p>
      <p>No blame.</p>
      <p>This pictures a state of inner oppression. Externally, all
      is well, one hasmeat and drink. But one is exhausted by the
      commonplaces of life, and thereseems to be no way of escape.
      Then help comes from a high place. A prince-inancient China
      princes wore scarlet knee bands- is in search of able
      helpers.But there are still obstructions to be overcome.
      Therefore it is important tomeet these obstructions in the
      visible realm by offerings and prayer. To setforth without
      being prepared would be disastrous, though not morally
      wrong.Here a disagreeable situation must be overcome by
      patience of spirit.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>A man permits himself to be oppressed by stone, And leans
      on thorns and thistles. He enters the house and does not see
      his wife. Misfortune.</p>
      <p>This shows a man who is restless and indecisive in times
      of adversity. Atfirst he wants to push ahead, then he
      encounters obstructions that, it istrue, mean oppression only
      when recklessly dealt with. He butts his headagainst a wall
      and in consequence feels himself oppressed by the wall. Then
      heleans on things that have in themselves no stability and
      that are merely ahazard for him who leans on them. Thereupon
      he turns back irresolutely andretires into his house, only to
      find, as a fresh disappointment, that his wifeis not there.
      Confucius says about this line:</p>
      <p>If a man permits himself to be oppressed by something that
      ought not tooppress him, his name will certainly be
      disgraced. If he leans on things uponwhich one cannot lean,
      his life will certainly be endangered. For him who isin
      disgrace and danger, the hour of death draws near; how can he
      then stillsee his wife?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>He comes very quietly, oppressed in a golden carriage.
      Humiliation, but the end is reached.</p>
      <p>A well-to-do man sees the need of the lower classes and
      would like very muchto be of help. But instead of proceeding
      with speed and energy where their isneed, he begins in a
      hesitant and measured way. Then he encountersobstructions.
      Powerful and wealthy acquaintances draw him into their
      circle;he has to do as they do and cannot withdraw from them.
      Hence he finds himselfin great embarrassment. But the trouble
      is transitory. The original strengthof his nature offsets the
      mistake he has made, and the goal is reached.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>His nose and feet are cut off. Oppression at the hands of
      the man with the purple knee bands. Joy comes softly. It
      furthers one to make offerings and libations.</p>
      <p>An individual who has the good of mankind at heart is
      oppressed from aboveand below (this is the meaning of the
      cutting off of nose an defeat). He findsno help among the
      people whose duty it would be to aid in the work of
      rescue(ministers wore purple knee bands). But little by
      little, things take a turnfor the better. Until that time, he
      should turn to God, firm in his innercomposure, and pray and
      offer sacrifice for the general well-being.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>He is oppressed by creeping vines. He moves uncertainly
      and says, "Movement brings remorse." If one feels remorse
      over this and makes a start, Good fortune comes.</p>
      <p>A man is oppressed by bonds that can easily be broken. The
      distress isdrawing to an end. But he is still irresolute; he
      is still influenced by theprevious condition and fears that
      he may have cause for regret if he makes amove. But as soon
      as he grasps the situation, changes this mental attitude,and
      makes a firm decision, he masters the oppression.</p>
