      52. Ken / Keeping Still, Mountain

    <div class="trigrams">
      above KeN KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN below KeN KEEPING STILL,
      MOUNTAIN
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The image of this hexagram is the mountain, the youngest son
      of heaven andearth. The male principle is at the top because
      it strives upward by nature;the female principle is below,
      since the direction of its movement has come toits normal
      end. In its application to man, the hexagram turns upon the
      problemof achieving a quiet heart. It is very difficult to
      bring quiet to the heart.While Buddhism strives for rest
      through an ebbing away of all movement innirvana, the Book of
      Changes holds that rest is merely a state of polaritythat
      always posits movement as its complement. Possibly the words
      of the textembody directions for the practice of yoga.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      KEEPING STILL. Keeping his back still
      <p>So that he no longer feels his body. He goes into his
      courtyard And does not see his people.</p>
      <p>No blame.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      True quiet means keeping still when the time has come to keep
      still, andgoing forward when the time has come to go forward.
      In this way rest andmovement are in agreement with the
      demands of the time, and thus there islight in life. The
      hexagram signifies the end and the beginning of allmovement.
      The back is named because in the back are located all the
      nervefibers that mediate movement. If the movement of these
      spinal nerves isbrought to a standstill, the ego, with its
      restlessness, disappears as itwere. When a man has thus
      become calm, he may turn to the outside world. He nolonger
      sees in it the struggle and tumult of individual beings, and
      thereforehe has that true peace of mind which is needed for
      understanding the greatlaws of the universe and for acting in
      harmony with them. Whoever acts fromthese deep levels makes
      no mistakes.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Mountains standing close together: The image of KEEPING
      STILL. Thus the superior man Does not permit his thoughts
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      To go beyond his situation.
      <p>The heart thinks constantly. This cannot be changed, but
      the movements ofthe heart-that is, a man's thoughts-should
      restrict themselves to theimmediate situation. All thinking
      that goes beyond this only makes the heartsore.</p>

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>Keeping his toes still.</p>
      <p>No blame. Continued perseverance furthers.</p>
      <p>Keeping the toes still means halting before one has even
      begun to move. Thebeginning is the time of few mistakes. At
      that time one is still in harmonywith primal innocence. Not
      yet influenced by obscuring interests and desires,one sees
      things intuitively as they really are. A man who halts at
      thebeginning, so long as he has not yet abandoned the truth,
      finds the right way.But persisting firmness is needed to keep
      one from drifting irresolutely.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Six in e second place means:
      <p>Keeping his calves still. He cannot rescue him whom he
      follows. His heart is not glad.</p>
      <p>The leg cannot move independently; it depends on the
      movement of the body.If a leg is suddenly stopped while the
      whole body is in vigorous motion, thecontinuing body movement
      will make one fall. The same is true of a man whoserves a
      master stronger than himself. He is swept along, and even
      though hemay himself halt on the path of wrongdoing, he can
      no longer check the otherin his powerful movement. Where the
      master presses forward, the servant, nomatter how good his
      intentions, cannot save him.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Nine in the third place means:
      <p>Keeping his hips still. Making his sacrum stiff.
      Dangerous. The heart suffocates.</p>
      <p>This refers to enforced quiet. The restless heart is to be
      subdued byforcible means. But fire when it is smothered
      changes into acrid smoke thatsuffocates as it spreads.
      Therefore, in exercises in meditation andconcentration, one
      ought not to try to force results. Rather, calmness
      mustdevelop naturally out of a state of inner composure. If
      one tries to inducecalmness by means of artificial rigidity,
      meditation will lead to veryunwholesome results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Six in the fourth place means:
      <p>Keeping his trunk still.</p>
      <p>No blame.</p>
      <p>As has been pointed out above in the comment on the
      Judgment, keeping theback at rest means forgetting the ego.
      This is the highest stage of rest. Herethis stage has not yet
      been reached: the individual in this instance, thoughable to
      keep the ego, with its thoughts and impulses, in a state of
      rest, isnot yet quite liberated from its dominance.
      Nonetheless, keeping the heart atrest is an important
      function, leading in the end to the complete eliminationof
      egotistic drives. Even though at this point one does not yet
      remain freefrom all the dangers of doubt and unrest, this
      frame of mind is not a mistake,as it leads ultimately to that
      other, higher level.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>Keeping his jaws still.</p>
      <p>The words have order. Remorse disappears.</p>
      <p>A man in a dangerous situation, especially when he is not
      adequate to it, isinclined to be very free with talk and
      presumptuous jokes. But injudiciousspeech easily leads to
      situations that subsequently give much cause forregret.
      However, if a man is reserved in speech, his words take ever
      moredefinite form, and every occasion for regret
      vanishes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Nine at the top means:
      <p>Noblehearted keeping still. Good fortune.</p>
      <p>This marks the consummation of the effort to attain
      tranquillity. One is atrest, not merely in a small,
      circumscribed way in regard to matters of detail,but one has
      also a general resignation in regard to life as a whole, and
      thisconfers peace and good fortune in relation to every
      individual matter.</p>
