    <div class="explanation">
      The name of the hexagram, Chun, really connotes a blade of
      grass pushingagainst an obstacle as it sprouts out of the
      earth--hence the meaning,"difficulty at the beginning." The
      hexagram indicates the way in which heavenand earth bring
      forth individual beings. It is their first meeting, which
      isbeset with difficulties. The lower trigram Chen is the
      Arousing; its motion isupward and its image is thunder. The
      upper trigram K'an stands for theAbysmal, the dangerous. Its
      motion is downward and its image is rain. Thesituation points
      to teeming, chaotic profusion; thunder and rain fill the
      air.But the chaos clears up. While the Abysmal sinks, the
      upward movementeventually passes beyond the danger. A
      thunderstorm brings release fromtension, and all things
      breathe freely again.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      DIFFICULTY AT THE BEGINNING works supreme success, Furthering
      through perseverance. Nothing should be undertaken. It
      furthers one to appoint helpers.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Times of growth are beset with difficulties. They resemble a
      first birth.But these difficulties arise from the very
      profusion of all that is strugglingto attain form .
      Everything is in motion: therefore if one perseveres there
      isa prospect of great success, in spite of the existing
      danger. When it is aman's fate to undertake such new
      beginnings, everything is still unformed,dark. Hence he must
      hold back, because any premature move might bringdisaster.
      Likewise, it is very important not to remain alone; in order
      toovercome the chaos he needs helpers. This is not to say,
      however, that hehimself should look on passively at what is
      happening. He must lend his handand participate with
      inspiration and guidance.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Clouds and thunder: The image of DIFFICULTY AT THE BEGINNING.
      Thus the superior man Brings order out of confusion.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      Clouds and thunder are represented by definite decorative
      lines; this meansthat in the chaos of difficulty at the
      beginning, order is already implicit.So too the superior man
      has to arrange and organize the inchoate profusion ofsuch
      times of beginning, just as one sorts out silk threads from a
      knottedtangle and binds them into skeins. In order to find
      one's place in theinfinity of being, one must be able both to
      separate and to unite.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>Hesitation and hindrance. It furthers one to remain
      persevering. It furthers one to appoint helpers.</p>
      <p>If a person encounters a hindrance at the beginning of an
      enterprise, hemust not try to force advance but must pause
      and take thought. However,nothing should put him off his
      course; he must persevere and constantly keepthe goal in
      sight. It is important to seek out the right assistants, but
      hecan find them only if he avoids arrogance and associated
      with his fellows in aspirit of humility. Only then will he
      attract those with whose help he cancombat the
      difficulties.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Six in the second place means:
      <p>Difficulties pile up. Horse and wagon part. He is not a
      robber; He wants to woo when the time comes. The maiden is
      chaste, She does not pledge herself. Ten years--then she
      pledges herself.</p>
      <p>We find ourselves beset by difficulties and hindrances.
      Suddenly there is aturn of affairs, as if someone were coming
      up with a horse and wagon andunhitching them. This event
      comes so unexpectedly that we assume the newcomerto be a
      robber. Gradually it becomes clear that he has no evil
      intentions butseeks to be friendly and to offer help. But
      this offer is not to be accepted,because it does not come
      from the right quarter. We must wait until the timeis
      fulfilled; ten years is a fulfilled cycle of time. Then
      normal conditionsreturn of themselves, and we can join forces
      with the friend intended for us.Using the image of a
      betrothed girl who remains true to her lover in face ofgrave
      conflicts, the hexagram gives counsel for a special
      situation. When intimes of difficulty a hindrance is
      encountered and unexpected relief isoffered from a source
      unrelated to us, we must be careful and not take
      uponourselves any obligations entailed by such help;
      otherwise our freedom ofdecision is impaired. If we bide our
      time, things will quiet down again, andwe shall attain what
      we have hoped for.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>Whoever hunts deer without the forester Only loses his way
      in the forest. The superior man understands the signs of the
      time And prefers to desist. To go on brings humiliation.</p>
      <p>If a man tries to hunt in a strange forest and has no
      guide, he loses hisway. When he finds himself in difficulties
      he must not try to steal out ofthem unthinkingly and without
      guidance. Fate cannot be duped; prematureeffort, without the
      necessary guidance, ends in failure and disgrace.Therefore
      the superior man, discerning the seeds of coming events,
      prefers torenounce a wish rather than to provoke failure and
      humiliation by trying toforce its fulfillment.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Six in the fourth place means:
      <p>Horse and wagon part. Strive for union. To go brings good
      fortune. Everything acts to further.</p>
      <p>We are in a situation in which it is our duty to act, but
      we lack sufficientpower. However, an opportunity to make
      connections offers itself. It must beseized. Neither false
      pride nor false reserve should deter us. Bringingoneself to
      take the first step, even when it involves a certain degree
      ofself-abnegation, is a sign of inner clarity. To accept help
      in a difficultsituation is not a disgrace. If the right
      helper is found, all goes well.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Nine in the fifth place means:
      <p>Difficulties in blessing. A little perseverance brings
      good fortune. Great perseverance brings misfortune.</p>
      <p>An individual is in a position in which he cannot so
      express his goodintentions that they will actually take shape
      and be understood. Other peopleinterpose and distort
      everything he does. He should then be cautious andproceed
      step by step. He must not try to force the consummation of a
      greatundertaking, because success is possible only when
      general confidence alreadyprevails. It is only through
      faithful and conscientious work, unobtrusivelycarried on,
      that the situation gradually clears up and the
      hindrancedisappears.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Six at the top means:
      <p>Horse and wagon part. Bloody tears flow.</p>
      <p>The difficulties at the beginning are too great for some
      persons. They getstuck and never find their way out; they
      fold their hands and give up thestruggle. Such resignation is
      the saddest of all things. Therefore Confuciussays of this
      line: "Bloody tears flow: one should not persist in
      this."</p>
