      4. Meng / Youthful Folly
    </div>
    <div class="trigrams">
      above KeN KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN below K'AN THE ABYSMAL,
      WATER
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      In this hexagram we are reminded of youth and folly in two
      different ways.The image of the upper trigram, Ken, is the
      mountain, that of the lower, K'an,is water; the spring rising
      at the foot of the mountain is the image ofinexperienced
      youth. Keeping still is the attribute of the upper trigram;
      thatof the lower is the abyss, danger. Stopping in perplexity
      on the brink of adangerous abyss is a symbol of the folly of
      youth. However, the two trigramsalso show the way of
      overcoming the follies of youth. Water is something thatof
      necessity flows on. When the spring gushes forth, it does not
      know at firstwhere it will go. But its steady flow fills up
      the deep place blocking itsprogress, and success is attained.

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      YOUTHFUL FOLLY has success. It is not I who seek the young
      fool; The young fool seeks me. At the first oracle I inform
      him. If he asks two or three times, it is importunity. If he
      importunes, I give him no information. Perseverance furthers.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      In the time of youth, folly is not an evil. One may succeed
      in spite of it,provided one finds an experienced teacher and
      has the right attitude towardhim. This means, first of all,
      that the youth himself must be conscious of hislack of
      experience and must seek out the teacher. Without this
      modesty andthis interest there is no guarantee that he has
      the necessary receptivity,which should express itself in
      respectful acceptance of the teacher. This isthe reason why
      the teacher must wait to be sought out instead of
      offeringhimself. Only thus can the instruction take place at
      the right time and in theright way. A teacher's answer to the
      question of a pupil ought to be clear anddefinite like that
      expected from an oracle; thereupon it ought to be acceptedas
      a key for resolution of doubts and a basis for decision. If
      mistrustful orunintelligent questioning is kept up, it serves
      only to annoy the teacher. Hedoes well to ignore it in
      silence, just as the oracle gives one answer onlyand refuses
      to be tempted by questions implying doubt. Given addition
      aperseverance that never slackens until the points are
      mastered one by one,real success is sure to follow. Thus the
      hexagram counsels the teacher as wellas the pupil.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      A spring wells up at the foot of the mountain: The image of
      YOUTH. Thus the superior man fosters his character By
      thoroughness in all that he does.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      A spring succeeds in flowing on and escapes stagnation by
      filling up all the
      <p>hollow places in its path. In the same way character is
      developed bythoroughness that skips nothing but, like water,
      gradually and steadily fillsup all gaps and so flows
      onward.</p>

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Six at the beginning means:
      <p>To make a fool develop It furthers one to apply
      discipline. The fetters should be removed. To go on in this
      way bring humiliation.</p>
      <p>Law is the beginning of education. Youth in its
      inexperience is inclined atfirst to take everything
      carelessly and playfully. It must be shown theseriousness of
      life. A certain measure of taking oneself in hand,
      broughtabout by strict discipline, is a good thing. He who
      plays with life neveramounts to anything. However, discipline
      should not degenerate into drill.Continuous drill has a
      humiliating effect and cripples a man's powers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>To bear with fools in kindliness brings good fortune. To
      know how to take women Brings good fortune. The son is
      capable of taking charge of the household.</p>
      <p>These lines picture a man who has no external power, but
      who has enoughstrength of mind to bear his burden of
      responsibility. He has the innersuperiority and that enable
      him to tolerate with kindliness the shortcomingsof human
      folly. The same attitude is owed to women as the weaker sex.
      One mustunderstand them and give them recognition in a spirit
      of chivalrousconsideration. Only this combination of inner
      strength with outer reserveenables one to take on the
      responsibility of directing a larger social bodywith real
      success.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Six in the third place means:
      <p>Take not a maiden who. When she sees a man of bronze,
      Loses possession of herself. Nothing furthers.</p>
      <p>A weak, inexperienced man, struggling to rise, easily
      loses his ownindividuality when he slavishly imitates a
      strong personality of higherstation. He is like a girl
      throwing herself away when she meets a strong man.Such a
      servile approach should not be encouraged, because it is bad
      both forthe youth and the teacher. A girl owes it to her
      dignity to wait until she iswooed. In both cases it is
      undignified to offer oneself, and no good comes ofaccepting
      such an offer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Six in the fourth place means:
      <p>Entangled folly bring humiliation.</p>
      <p>For youthful folly it is the most hopeless thing to
      entangle itself in emptyimaginings. The more obstinately it
      clings to such unreal fantasies, the morecertainly will
      humiliation overtake it. Often the teacher, when
      confrontedwith such entangled folly, has no other course but
      to leave the fool tohimself for a time, not sparing him the
      humiliation that results. This isfrequently the only means of
      rescue.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>Childlike folly brings good fortune.</p>
      <p>An inexperienced person who seeks instruction in a
      childlike and unassumingway is on the right path, for the man
      devoid of arrogance who subordinatedhimself to his teacher
      will certainly be helped.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Nine at the top means:
      <p>In punishing folly It does not further one To commit
      transgressions. The only thing that furthers Is to prevent
      transgressions. Sometimes an incorrigible fool must be
      punished. He who will not heed willbe made to feel. This
      punishment is quite different from a preliminary shakingup.
      But the penalty should not be imposed in anger; it must be
      restricted toan objective guarding against unjustified
      excesses. Punishment is never an endin itself but serves
      merely to restore order. This applies not only in regardto
      education but also in regard to the measures taken by a
      government againsta populace guilty of transgressions.
      Governmental interference should alwaysbe merely preventive
      and should have as its sole aim the establishment ofpublic
      security and peace.</p>
