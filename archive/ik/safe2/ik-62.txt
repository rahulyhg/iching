62. Hsiao Kuo / Preponderance of the Small

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above CHeN THE AROUSING, THUNDER  below KeN KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN

</div><div class="explanation">
 While in the hexagram Ta Kuo, PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT<p> 28, the strong lines preponderate and are within, inclosed between weaklines at the top and bottom, the present hexagram has weak linespreponderating, though here again they are on the outside, the strong linesbeing within. This indeed is the basis of the exceptional situation indicatedby the hexagram. When strong lines are outside, we have the hexagram I,PROVIDING NOURISHMENT<p> 27, or Chung Fu, INNER TRUTH,<p> 61; neither represents and exceptional state. When strong elements withinpreponderate, they necessarily enforce their will. This creates struggle andexceptional conditions in general. But in the present hexagram it is the weakelement that perforce must mediate with the outside world. If a man occupies aposition of authority for which he is by nature really inadequate,extraordinary prudence is necessary.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 PREPONDERANCE OF THE SMALL. Success.  Perseverance furthers.<p> Small things may be done; great things should not be done.

</div><div class="explanation">
 The flying bird brings the message:  It is not well to strive upward,  It is well to remain below.  Great good fortune.<p> Exceptional modesty and conscientiousness are sure to be rewarded withsuccess; however, if a man is not to throw himself away, it is important thatthey should not become empty form and subservience but be combined always witha correct dignity in personal behavior. We must understand the demands of thetime in order to find the necessary offset for its deficiencies and damages.In any event we must not count on great success, since the requisite strengthis lacking. In this lies the importance of the message that one should notstrive after lofty things but hold to lowly things. The structure of thehexagram gives rise to the idea that this message is brought by a bird. In TaKuo, PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT<p> 28, the four strong, heavy lines within, supported only by two weak lineswithout, give the image of a sagging ridgepole. Here the supporting weak linesare both outside and preponderant; this gives the image of a soaring bird. Buta bird should not try to surpass itself and fly into the sun; it shoulddescend to the earth, where its nest is. In this way it gives the messageconveyed by the hexagram.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Thunder on the mountain:  The image of PREPONDERANCE OF THE SMALL. Thus in his conduct the superior man gives preponderance to reverence.  In bereavement he gives preponderance to grief.  In his expenditures he gives preponderance to thrift.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Thunder on the mountain is different from thunder on the plain. In themountains, thunder seems much nearer; outside the mountains, it is lessaudible than the thunder of an ordinary storm. Thus the superior man derivesan imperative from this image: he must always fix his eyes more closely andmore directly on duty than does the ordinary man, even though this might makehis behavior seem petty to the outside world. He is exceptionallyconscientious in his actions. In bereavement emotion means more to him thanceremoniousness. In all his personal expenditures he is extremely simple andunpretentious. In comparison with the man of the masses, all this makes himstand out as exceptional. But the essential significance of his attitude liesin the fact that in external matters he is on the side of the lowly.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>The bird meets with misfortune through flying.<p> A bird ought to remain in the nest until it is fledged. If it tries to flybefore this, it invites misfortune. Extraordinary measures should be resortedto only when all else fails. At first we ought to put up with traditional waysas long as possible; otherwise we exhaust ourselves and our energy and stillachieve nothing.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>She passes by her ancestor  And meets her ancestress.  He does not reach his prince  And meets the official.<p> No blame.<p> Two exceptional situations are instanced here. In the temple of ancestors,where alternation of generations prevails, the grandson stands on the sameside as the grandfather. Hence his closest relations are with the grandfather.The present line designates the grandson's wife, who during the sacrificepasses by the ancestor and goes toward the ancestress. This unusual behavioris, however, an expression of her modesty. She ventures rather to approach theancestress, for she feels related to her by their common sex. Hence heredeviation from the rule is not a mistake. Another image is that of theofficial who, in compliance with regulation, first seeks an audience with hisprince. If he is not successful in this, he does not try to force anything butgoes about conscientious fulfillment of his duty, taking his place among theother officials. This extraordinary restraint is likewise not a mistake inexceptional times. (The rule is that every official should first have anaudience with the prince by whom he is appointed. Here the appointment is madeby the minister.)

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>If one is not extremely careful,<p> Somebody may come up from behind and strike him.  Misfortune.<p> At certain times extraordinary caution is absolutely necessary. But it isjust in such life situations that we find upright and strong personalitieswho, conscious of being in the right, disdain to hold themselves on guard,because they consider it petty. Instead, they go their way proud andunconcerned. But this self-confidence deludes them. There are dangers lurkingfor which they are unprepared. Yet such danger is not unavoidable; one canescape it if he understands that the time demands that he pay especialattention to small and insignificant thing.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Nine in the fourth place means: <p>No blame. He meets him without passing by.  Going brings danger. One must be on guard.  Do not act. Be constantly persevering.<p> Hardness of character is tempered by yielding position so that no mistakesare made. The situation here calls for extreme caution; one must make noattempt of one's own initiative to reach the desired end. And if one were togo on, endeavoring one must be on guard and not act but continue inwardly topersevere. 

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Six in the fifth place means: <p>Dense clouds,<p> No rain from our western territory.<p> The prince shoots and hits him who is in the cave.<p> As a high place is pictured here, the image of a flying bird has become thatof flying clouds. But dense as the clouds are, they race across the sky andgive no rain. Similarly, in exceptional times there may be a born ruler who isqualified to set the world in order, but who cannot achieve anything or conferblessing on the people because he stands alone and has no helpers. Is suchtimes a man must seek out helpers with whose aid he can carry out the task.But these helpers must be modestly sought out in the retirement to which theyhave withdrawn. It is not in the fame nor their great names but their genuineachievements that are important. Through such modesty the right man is found,and the exceptional task is carried out in spite of all difficulties.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Six at the top means: <p>He passes him by, not meeting him.<p> The flying bird leaves him.  Misfortune.<p> This means bad luck and injury.<p> If one overshoots the goal, one cannot hit it. If a bird will not come toits nest but flies higher and higher, it eventually falls into the hunter'snet. He who in times of extraordinary salience of small things does not knowhow to call a halt, but restlessly seeks to press on and on, draws uponhimself misfortune at the hands of gods and men, because he deviates from theorder of nature.
