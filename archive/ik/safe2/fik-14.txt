      The fire in heaven above shines far, and all things stand out
      in the lightand become manifest. The weak fifth line occupies
      the place of honor and allthe strong lines are in accord with
      it.All things come to the man who ismodest and kind in a high

      THE JUDGMENT
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE. Supreme success.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The two trigrams indicate that strength and clarity unite.
      Possessions greatmeasure is determined by fate and accords
      with the time. How is it possiblethat the weak line has power
      to hold the strong lines fast and to possessthem? It is done
      by virtue of unselfish modesty. The time is favorable--a
      timeof strength within, clarity and culture without. Power is
      expressing itself ingraceful and controlled way. This brings
      supreme success and wealth.

      THE IMAGE
    </div>
    <div class="ancient">
      Fire in heaven above: The image of POSSESSION IN GREAT
      MEASURE. Thus the superior man curbs evil and furthers good,
      And thereby obeys the benevolent will of heaven.
    </div>
    <div class="explanation">
      The sun in heaven above, shedding light over everything one
      earth, is theimage of possession on a grand scale. But a
      possession of this sort must beadministered properly. The sun
      brings both evil and good into the light ofday. Man must
      combat and curb the evil, and must favor and promote the
      good.Only in this way does he fulfill the benevolent will of
      God, who desires onlygood and not evil.

    THE LINES
    <div class="line" id="1">
      Nine at the beginning means:
      <p>No relationship with what is harmful; There is no blame in
      this. If one remains conscious of difficulty, One remains
      without blame.</p>
      <p>Great possession that is still in its beginnings and that
      has not yet beenchallenged brings no blame, since there has
      been no opportunity to makemistakes. Yet there are many
      difficulties to be overcome. It is only byremaining conscious
      of theses difficulties that one can keep inwardly free
      ofpossible arrogance and wastefulness, and thus in principle
      overcome all causefor blame.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="2">
      Nine in the second place means:
      <p>A big wagon for loading. One may undertake something. No
      blame.</p>
      <p>Great possession consists not only in the quantity of
      goods at one'sdisposal, but first and foremost, in their
      mobility and utility, for then theycan be used in
      undertakings, and we remain free of embarrassment and
      mistakes.The big wagon, which will carry a heavy load and in
      which one can journey farmmeans that there are at hand able
      helpers who give their support t and areequal to their task.
      One can load great responsibility upon such persons, andthis
      is necessary in important undertakings.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="3">
      Nine in the third place means:
      <p>A prince offers it to the Son of Heaven. A petty man
      cannot do this.</p>
      <p>A magnanimous, liberal-minded man should not regard what
      he possesses as hisexclusive personal property , but should
      place it at the disposal of the ruleror of the people at
      large. In so doing, he takes the right attitude toward
      hispossession, which as private property can never endure. A
      petty man isincapable of this. He is harmed by great
      possessions, because instead ofsacrificing them, he would
      keep them for himself.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="4">
      Nine in the fourth place means:
      <p>He makes a difference Between himself and his neighbor. No
      blame.</p>
      <p>This characterizes the position of a man placed among rich
      and powerfulneighbors. It is a dangerous position. He must
      look neither to the right norto the left, and must shun envy
      and the temptation to vie with others. In thisway he remains
      free of mistakes.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="5">
      Six in the fifth place means:
      <p>He whose truth is accessible, yet dignified, Has good
      fortune.</p>
      <p>The situation is very favorable. People are being won not
      by coercion but byunaffected sincerity, so that they are
      attached to us in sincerity and truth.However, benevolence
      alone is not sufficient at the time of POSSESSION INGREAT
      MEASURE. For insolence might begin to spread. Insolence must
      be kept inbounds by dignity; then good fortune is
      assured.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="line" id="6">
      Nine at the top means:
      <p>He is blessed by heaven. Good fortune. Nothing that does
      not further.</p>
      <p>In the fullness of possession and at the height of power,
      one remains modestand gives honor to the sage who stands
      outside the affairs of the world. Bythis means one puts
      oneself under the beneficent influence descending formheaven,
      and all goes well. Confucius says of this line:</p>
      <p>To bless means to help. Heaven helps the man who is
      devoted; men help theman who is true. He who walks in truth
      and is devoted in his thinking, andfurthermore reveres the
      worthy, is blessed by heaven. He has good fortune, andthere
      is nothing that would not further.</p>
