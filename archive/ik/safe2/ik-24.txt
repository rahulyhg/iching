24. Fu / Return (The Turning Point)

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH  below CHeN THE AROUSING, THUNDER

</div><div class="explanation">
 The idea of a turning point arises from the fact that after the dark lineshave pushed all of the light lines upward and out of the hexagram, anotherlight line enters the hexagram from below. The time of darkness is past. Thewinter solstice brings the victory of light. This hexagram is linked with theeleventh month, the month of the solstice (December-January).

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 RETURN. Success.  Going out and coming in without error.  Friends come without blame.  To and fro goes the way.  On the seventh day comes return.  It furthers one to have somewhere to go.

</div><div class="explanation">
 After a time of decay comes the turning point. The powerful light that hasbeen banished returns. There is movement, but it is not brought about byforce. The upper trigram K'un is characterized by devotion; thus the movementis natural, arising spontaneously. For this reason the transformation of theold becomes easy. The old is discarded and the new is introduced. Bothmeasures accord with the time; therefore no harm results. Societies of peoplesharing the same views are formed. But since these groups come together infull public knowledge and are in harmony with the time, all selfish separatisttendencies are excluded, and no mistake is made. The idea of RETURN is basedon the course of nature. The movement is cyclic, and the course completesitself. Therefore it is not necessary to hasten anything artificially.Everything comes of itself at the appointed time. This is the meaning ofheaven and earth. All movements are accomplished in six stages, and theseventh brings return. Thus the winter solstice, with which the decline of theyear begins, comes in the seventh month after the summer solstice; so toosunrise comes in the seventh double hour after sunset. Therefore seven is thenumber of the young light, and it arises when six, the number of the greatdarkness, is increased by one. In this way the state of rest gives place tomovement.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Thunder within the earth:  The image of THE TURNING POINT.  Thus the kings of antiquity closed the passes  At the time of solstice.  Merchants and strangers did not go about,  And the ruler  Did not travel through the provinces.

</div><div class="explanation">
 The winter solstice has always been celebrated in China as the resting timeof the year--a custom that survives in the time of rest observed at the newyear. In winter the life energy, symbolized by thunder, the Arousing, is stillunderground. Movement is just at its beginning; therefore it must bestrengthened by rest so that it will not be dissipated by being usedprematurely. This principle, i.e., of allowing energy that is renewing itselfto be reinforced by rest, applies to all similar situations. The return ofhealth after illness, the return of understanding after an estrangement:everything must be treated tenderly and with care at the beginning, so thatthe return may lead to a flowering.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Nine at the beginning means: <p>Return from a short distance.  No need for remorse.  Great good fortune.<p> Slight digressions from the good cannot be avoided, but one must turn backin time, before going too far. This is especially important in the developmentof character; every faintly evil thought must be put aside immediately, beforeit goes too far and takes root in the mind. Then there is no cause forremorse, and all goes well.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>Quiet return. Good fortune.<p> Return always calls for a decision and is an act of self-mastery. It is madeeasier if a man is in good company. If he can bring himself to put aside prideand follow the example of good men, good fortune results.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Six in the third place means: <p>Repeated return. Danger. No blame.<p> There are people of a certain inner instability who feel a constant urge toreverse themselves. There is danger in continually deserting the good becauseof uncontrolled desires, then turning back to it again because of a betterresolution. However, since this does not lead to habituation in evil, ageneral inclination to overcome the defect is not wholly excluded/

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>Walking in the midst of others,  One returns alone.<p> A man is in a society composed of inferior people, but is connectedspiritually with a strong and good friend, and this makes him turn back alone.Although nothing is said of reward and punishment, this return is certainlyfavorable, for such a resolve to choose the good brings its own reward.

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Six in the fifth place means: <p>Noblehearted return. No remorse.<p> When the time for return has come, a man should not take shelter in trivialexcuses, but should look within and examine himself. And if he has donesomething wrong he should make a noblehearted resolve to confess his fault. Noone will regret having taken this road.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Six at the top means: <p>Missing the return. Misfortune.  Misfortune from within and without.  If armies are set marching in this way,  One will in the end suffer a great defeat,  Disastrous for the ruler of the country.  For ten years  It will not be possible to attack again.<p> If a man misses the right time for return, he meets with misfortune. Themisfortune has its inner cause in a wrong attitude toward the world. Themisfortune coming upon him for without results from this wrong attitude. Whatis pictured here is blind obstinacy and the judgment that is visited upon it.
