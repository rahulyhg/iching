6. Sung / Conflict

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above CH'IEN THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN  below K'AN THE ABYSMAL, WATER

</div><div class="explanation">
 The upper trigram, whose image is heaven, has an upward movement; the lowertrigram, water, in accordance with its nature tends downward. Thus the twohalves move away from each other, giving rise to the idea of conflict. Theattribute of the Creative is strength, that of the Abysmal is danger, guile.Where cunning has force before it, there is conflict. A third indication ofconflict, in terms of character, is presented by the combination of deepcunning within and fixed determination outwardly. A person of this characterwill certainly be quarrelsome.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 CONFLICT. You are sincere  And are being obstructed.  A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.  Going through to the end brings misfortune.  It furthers one to see the great man.  It does not further one to cross the great water.

</div><div class="explanation">
 Conflict develops when one feels himself to be in the right and runs intoopposition. If one is not convinced of being in the right, opposition leads tocraftiness or high-handed encroachment but not to open conflict. If a man isentangled in a conflict, his only salvation lies in being so clear-headed andinwardly strong that he is always ready to come to terms by meeting theopponent halfway. To carry one the conflict to the bitter end has evil effectseven when one is the right, because the enmity is then perpetuated. It isimportant to see the great man, that is, an impartial man whose authority isgreat enough to terminate the conflict amicably or assure a just decision. Intimes of strife, crossing the great water is to be avoided, that is, dangerousenterprises are not to be begun, because in order to be successful theyrequire concerted unity of focus. Conflict within weakens the power to conquerdanger without.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Heaven and water go their opposite ways:  The image of CONFLICT.  Thus in all his transactions the superior man  Carefully considers the beginning.

</div><div class="explanation">
 The image indicates that the causes of conflict are latent in the opposingtendencies of the two trig rams. Once these opposing tendencies appear,conflict is inevitable. To avoid it, therefore, everything must be takencarefully into consideration in the very beginning. If rights and duties areexactly defined, or if, in a group, the spiritual trends of the individualsharmonize, the cause of conflict is removed in advance.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>If one does not perpetuate the affair,  There is a little gossip.  In the end, good fortune comes.<p> While a conflict is in the incipient stage, the best thing To do is to dropthe issue. Especially when the adversary is stronger, it is not advisable torisk pushing the conflict to a decision. It may come to a slight dispute, butin the end all goes well.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Nine in the second place means: <p>One cannot engage in conflict;  One returns home, gives way.  The people of his town,  Three hundred households,  Remain free of guilt.<p> In a struggle with an enemy of superior strength, retreat is no disgrace.Timely withdrawal prevents bad consequences. If, out of a false sense ofhonor, a man allowed himself to be tempted into an unequal conflict, he wouldbe drawing down disaster upon himself. In such a case a wise and conciliatoryattitude benefits the whole community, which will then not be drawn into theconflict.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Six in the third place means: <p>To nourish oneself on ancient virtue induces perseverance.  Danger. In the end, good fortune comes.  If by chance you are in the service of a king,  Seek not works.<p> This is a warning of the danger that goes with an expansive disposition.Only that which has been honestly acquired through merit remains a permanentpossession. It can happen that such a possession may be contested, but sinceit is really one's own, one cannot be robbed of it. Whatever a man possessesthrough the strength of his own nature cannot be lost. If one enters theservice of a superior, one can avoid conflict only by not seeking works forthe sake of prestige. It is enough if the work is done: let the honor go tothe other.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Nine in the fourth place means: <p>One cannot engage in conflict.  One turns back and submits to fate,  Changes one's attitude,  And finds peace in perseverance.  Good fortune.<p> This refers to a person whose inner attitude at first lacks peace. He doesnot feel content with his situation and would like to improve it throughconflict. In contrast tot the situation of the nine in the second place, he isdealing with a weaker opponent and might therefore succeed. But he cannotcarry on the fight, because, since right is not on his side, he cannot justifythe conflict to his conscience. Therefore he turns back and accepts his fate.He changes his mind and finds lasting peace in being at one with eternal law.This brings good fortune.  

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Nine in the fifth place means: <p>To contend before him  Brings supreme good fortune.<p> This refers to an arbiter in a conflict who is powerful and just, and strongenough to lend weight to the right side. A dispute can be turned over to himwith confidence. If one is in the right, one attains great good fortune.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Nine at the top means: <p>Even if by chance a leather belt is bestowed on one,'  By the end of a morning  It will have been snatched away three times.<p> Here we have someone who has carried a conflict to the bitter end and hastriumphed. He is granted a decoration, but his happiness does not last. He isattacked again and again, and the result is conflict without end.
