16. Yu / Enthusiasm

 above CHeN THE AROUSING, THUNDER  below K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH

</div><div class="explanation">
 The strong line in the fourth place, that of the leading official, meetswith response and obedience from all the other lines, which are all weak. Theattribute of the upper trigram, Chen, is movement; the attributes of K'un, thelower, are obedience and devotion. This begins a movement that meets withdevotion and therefore inspires enthusiasm, carrying all with it. Of greatimportance, furthermore, is the law of movement along the line of leastresistance, which in this hexagram is enunciated as the law for natural eventsand for human life.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 ENTHUSIASM. It furthers one to install helpers  And to set armies marching.

</div><div class="explanation">
 The time of ENTHUSIASM derives from the fact that there is at hand aneminent man who is in sympathy with the spirit of the people and acts inaccord with it. Hence he finds universal and willing obedience. To arouseenthusiasm it is necessary for a man to adjust himself and his ordinances tothe character of those whom he has to lead. The inviolability of natural lawsrests on this principle of movement along the line of least resistance. Theseslaws are not forces external to things but represent the harmony of movementimmanent in them. That is why the celestial bodies do not deviate from theirorbits and why all events in nature occur with fixed regularity. It is thesame with human society: only such laws are rooted in popular sentiment can beenforced, while laws violating this sentiment merely arouse resentment. Again,it is enthusiasm that enables us to install helpers for the completion of anundertaking without fear of secret opposition. It is enthusiasm too that canunify mass movements, as in war, so that they achieve victory.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Thunder comes resounding out of the earth:  The image of ENTHUSIASM.  Thus the ancient kings made music  In order to honor merit,  And offered it with splendor  To the Supreme Deity,  Inviting their ancestors to be present.

</div><div class="explanation">
 When, at the beginning of summer, thunder--electrical energy--comes rushingforth from the earth again, and the first thunderstorm refreshes nature, aprolonged state of tension is resolved. Joy and relief make themselves felt.So too, music has power to ease tension within the heart and to loosen thegrip of obscure emotions. The enthusiasm of the heart expresses itselfinvoluntarily in a burst of song, in dance and rhythmic movement of the body.From immemorial times the inspiring effect of the invisible sound that movesall hearts, and draws them together, has mystified mankind. Rulers have madeuse of this natural taste for music; they elevated and regulated it. Music waslooked upon as something serious and holy, designed to purify the feelings ofmen. It fell to music to glorify the virtues of heroes and thus to construct abridge to the world of the unseen. In the temple men drew near to God withmusic and pantomimes (out of this later the theater developed). Religiousfeeling for the Creator of the world was united with the most sacred of humanfeelings, that of reverence for the ancestors. The ancestors were invited tothese divine services as guests of the Ruler of Heaven and as representativesof humanity in the higher regions. This uniting of the human past with theDivinity in solemn moments of religious inspiration established the bondbetween God and man. The ruler who revered the Divinity in revering hisancestors became thereby the Son of Heaven, in whom the heavenly and theearthly world met in mystical contact. These ideas are the final summation ofChinese culture. Confucius has said of the great sacrifice at which theserites were performed: "He who could wholly comprehend this sacrifice couldrule the world as though it were spinning on his hand."

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Six at the beginning means: <p>Enthusiasm that expresses itself  Brings misfortune.<p> A man in an inferior position has aristocratic connections about which heboasts enthusiastically. This arrogance inevitably invites misfortune.  Enthusiasm should never be an egotistic emotion; it is justified only when itis a general feeling that unites one with others.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>Firm as a rock. Not a whole day.  Perseverance brings good fortune.<p> This describes a person who does not allow himself to be misled by anyillusions. While others are letting themselves be dazzled by enthusiasm, herecognizes with perfect clarity the first signs of the time. Thus he neitherflatters those above nor neglects those beneath him; he is as firm as a rock.When the first sign of discord appears, he knows the right moment forwithdrawing and does not delay even for a day. Perseverance in such conductwill bring good fortune. Confucius says about this line: <p> To know the seeds, that is divine indeed. In his association with thoseabove him, the superior man does not flatter. In his association with thosebeneath him, he is not arrogant. For he knows the seeds. The seeds are thefirst imperceptible beginning of movement, the first trace of good fortune (ormisfortune) that shows itself. The superior man perceives the seeds andimmediately takes actin. He does not wait even a whole day. In the Book ofChanges it is said: "Firm as a rock. Not a whole day. Perseverance brings goodfortune."<p> Firm as a rock, what need of a whole day?<p> . The judgment can be known.<p> . The superior man knows what is hidden and what is evident.  He knows weakness, he knows strength as well.  Hence the myriads look up to him.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Six in the third place means: <p>Enthusiasm that looks upward creates remorse.  Hesitation brings remorse.<p> This line is the opposite of the preceding one: the latter bespeaks self-reliance, while here there is enthusiastic looking up to a leader. If a manhesitates too long, this also will bring remorse. The right moment forapproach must be seized: only then will he do the right thing.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Nine in the fourth place means: <p>The source of enthusiasm.  He achieves great things.  Doubt not.  You gather friends around you  As a hair clasp gathers the hair.<p> This describes a man who is able to awaken enthusiasm through his ownsureness and freedom from hesitation. He attracts people because he has nodoubts and is wholly sincere. Owing to his confidence in them he wins theirenthusiastic co-operation and attains success. Just as a clasp draws the hairtogether and hold it, so he draws man together by the support he gives them.

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Six in the fifth place means: <p>Persistently ill, and still does not die.<p> Here enthusiasm is obstructed. A man is under constant pressure, whichprevents him from breathing freely. However, this pressure has its advantage--it prevents him from consuming his powers in empty enthusiasm. Thus constantpressure can actually serve to keep one alive.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Six at the top means:  <p>Deluded enthusiasm.  But if after completion one changes,  There is no blame.<p> It is a bad thing for a man to let himself be deluded by enthusiasm. But ifthis delusion has run its course, and he is still capable of changing, then heis freed of error. A sober awakening from false enthusiasm is quite possibleand very favorable.
