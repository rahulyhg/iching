 This hexagram is the evolution of T'ai PEACE<p> 11. The transition from confusion to order is completed, and everything isin its proper place even in particulars. The strong lines are in the strongplaces, the weak lines in the weak places. This is a very favorable outlook,yet it gives reason for thought. For it is just when perfect equilibrium hasbeen reached that any movement may cause order to revert to disorder. The onestrong line that has moved to the top, thus effecting complete order indetails, is followed by the other lines. Each moving according to its nature,and thus suddenly there arises again the hexagram P'i, STANDSTILL<p> 12. Hence the present hexagram indicates the conditions of a time of climax,which necessitate the utmost caution.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 AFTER COMPLETION. Success in small matters.  Perseverance furthers.  At the beginning good fortune.  At the end disorder.

</div><div class="explanation">
 The transition from the old to the new time is already accomplished. Inprinciple, everything stands systematized, and it si only in regard to detailsthat success is still to be achieved. In respect to this, however, we must becareful to maintain the right attitude. Everything proceeds as if of its ownaccord, and this can all too easily tempt us to relax and let thing take theircourse without troubling over details. Such indifference is the root of allevil. Symptoms of decay are bound to be the result. Here we have the ruleindicating the usual course of history. But this rule is not an inescapablelaw. He who understands it is in position to avoid its effects by dint ofunremitting perseverance and caution.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 Water over fire: the image of the condition  In AFTER COMPLETION. Thus the superior man Takes thought of misfortune  And arms himself against it in advance.

</div><div class="explanation">
 When water in a kettle hangs over fire, the two elements stand in relationand thus generate energy (cf. the production of steam). But the resultingtension demands caution. If the water boils over, the fire is extinguished anits energy is lost. If the heat is too great, the water evaporates into theair. These elements here brought in to relation and thus generating energy areby nature hostile to each other. Only the most extreme caution can preventdamage. In life too there are junctures when all forces are in balance andwork in harmony, so that everything seems to be in the best of order. In suchtimes only the sage recognizes the moments that bode danger and knows how tobanish it by means of timely precautions.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Nine at the beginning means: <p>He breaks his wheels.  He gets his tail in the water.<p> No blame.<p> In times following a great transition, everything is pressing forward,striving in the direction of development and progress. But this pressingforward at the beginning is not good; it overshoots the mark and leads withcertainty to loss and collapse. Therefore a man of strong character does notallow himself to be infected by the general intoxication but checks his coursein time. He may indeed not remain altogether untouched by the disastrousconsequences of the general pressure, but he is hit only from behind like afox that, having crossed the water, at the last minute gets its tail wet. Hewill not suffer any real harm, because his behavior has been correct.

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>The woman loses the curtain of her carriage.  Do not run after it;  On the seventh day you will get it.<p> When a woman drove out in her carriage, she had a curtain that hid her fromthe glances of the curious. It was regarded as a breach of propriety to driveon if this curtain was lost. Applied to public life, this means that a man whowants to achieve something is not receiving that confidence of the authoritieswhich he needs, so to speak, for his personal protection. Especially in times"after completion" it may happen that those who have come to power growarrogant and conceited and no longer trouble themselves about fostering newtalent. This as a rule results in office seeking. If a man's superiorswithhold their trust from him, he will seek ways and means of getting it andof drawing attention to himself. We are warned against such an unworthyprocedure: "Do not seek it." Do not throw yourself away on the world, but waittranquilly and develop your personal worth by your own efforts. Times change.When the six stages of the hexagram have passed, the new era dawns. That whichis a man's own cannot be permanently lost. It comes to him of its own accord.He need only be able to wait.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>The Illustrious Ancestor  Disciplines the Devil's Country.  After three years he conquers it.  Inferior people must not be employed.<p> "Illustrious Ancestor" is the dynastic title of the Emperor Wu Ting of theYin dynasty. After putting his realm in order with a strong hand, he wagedlong colonial wars for the subjection of the Huns who occupied the northernborderland with constant threat of incursions. The situation described is asfollows. After times of completion, when a new power has arisen and everythingwithin the country has been set in order, a period of colonial expansionalmost inevitably follows. Then as a rule long-drawn-out struggles must bereckoned with. For this reason, a correct colonial policy is especiallyimportant. The territory won at such bitter cost must not be regarded as analmshouse for people who in one way or another have hade themselves impossibleat home, but who are thought to be quite good enough for the colonies. Such apolicy ruins at the outset any chance of success. This holds true in small aswell as large matters, because it is not only rising states that carry on acolonial policy; the urge to expand, with its accompanying dangers, is partand parcel of every ambitious undertaking.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>The finest clothes turn to rags.  Be careful all day long.<p> In a time of flowering culture, an occasional convulsion is bound to occur,uncovering a hidden evil within society and at first causing a greatsensation. But since the situation is favorable on the whole, such evils caneasily be glossed over and concealed from the public. Then everything isforgotten and peace apparently reigns complacently once more. However, to thethoughtful man, such occurrences are grave omens that he does not neglect.This is the only way of averting evil consequences.

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Nine in the fifth place means: <p>The neighbor in the east who slaughters an ox  Does not attain as much real happiness  As the neighbor in the west  With his small offering.<p> Religious attitudes are likewise influenced by the spiritual atmosphereprevailing in times after completion. In divine worship the simple old formsare replaced by an ever more elaborate ritual and an ever greater outwarddisplay. But inner seriousness is lacking in this show of magnificence; humancaprice takes the place of conscientious obedience to the divine will.However, while man sees what is before his eyes, God looks into the heart.Therefore a simple sacrifice offered with real piety holds a greater blessingthan an impressive service without warmth.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Six at the top means: <p>He gets his head in the water. Danger.<p> Here in conclusion another warning is added. After crossing a stream, aman's head can get into the water only if he is so imprudent as to turn back.As long as he goes forward and does not look back, he escapes this danger. Butthere is a fascination in standing still and looking back on a peril overcome.However, such vain self-admiration brings misfortune. It leads only to danger,and unless one finally resolves to go forward without pausing, one falls avictim to this danger.<p>
