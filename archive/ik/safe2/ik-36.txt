36. Ming I / Darkening of the light

</div><div class="trigrams">
 above K'UN THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH  below LI THE CLINGING, FIRE

</div><div class="explanation">
 Here the sun has sunk under the earth and is therefore darkened. The name ofthe hexagram means literally "wounding of the bright"; hence the individuallines contain frequent references to wounding. The situation is the exactopposite of that in the foregoing hexagram. In the latter a wise man at thehead of affairs has able helpers, and in company with them makes progress;here a man of dark nature is in a position of authority and brings harm to thewise and able man.

 THE JUDGMENT

</div><div class="ancient">
 DARKENING OF THE LIGHT. In adversity  It furthers one to be persevering.  

</div><div class="explanation">
 One must not unresistingly let himself be swept along by unfavorablecircumstances, nor permit his steadfastness to be shaken. He can avoid this bymaintaining his inner light, while remaining outwardly yielding and tractable.With this attitude he can overcome even the greatest adversities. In somesituations indeed a man must hide his light, in order to make his will prevailinspite of difficulties in his immediate environment. Perseverance must dwellin inmost consciousness and should not be discernible from without. Only thusis a man able to maintain his will in the face of difficulties.

 THE IMAGE

</div><div class="ancient">
 The light has sunk into the earth: The image of DARKENING OF THE LIGHT. Thus does the superior man live with the great mass:  He veils his light, yet still shines.

</div><div class="explanation">
 In a time of darkness it is essential to be cautious and reserved. Oneshould not needlessly awaken overwhelming enmity by inconsiderate behavior. Insuch times one ought not to fall in with the practices of others; neithershould one drag them censoriously into the light. In social intercourse oneshould not try to be all-knowing. One should let many things pass, withoutbeing duped.

 THE LINES

<div class="line" id="1">
 Nine at the beginning means: <p>Darkening of the light during flight.  He lowers his wings.<p> The superior man does not eat for three days  On his wanderings.  But he has somewhere to go.<p> The host has occasion to gossip about him.<p> With grandiose resolve a man endeavors to soar above all obstacles, but thusencounters a hostile fate. He retreats and evades the issue. The time isdifficult. Without rest, he must hurry along, with no permanent abiding place.If he does not want to make compromises within himself, but insists onremaining true to his principles, he suffers deprivation. Never the less hehas a fixed goal to strive for even though the people with whom he lives donot understand him and speak ill of him. 

</div><div class="line" id="2">
 Six in the second place means: <p>Darkening of the light injures him in the left thigh.  He gives aid with the strength of a horse.  Good fortune.<p> Here the Lord of Light is in a subordinate place and is wounded by the Lordof Darkness. But the injury is not fatal; it is only a hindrance. Rescue isstill possible. The wounded man gives no thought to himself; he thinks only ofsaving the others who are also in danger. Therefore he tries with all hisstrength to save all that can be saved. There is good fortune in thus actingaccording to duty.

</div><div class="line" id="3">
 Nine in the third place means: <p>Darkening of the light during the hunt in the south.<p> Their great leader is captured.  One must not expect perseverance too soon.<p> It seems as if chance were at work. While the strong, loyal man is strivingeagerly and in good faith to create order, he meets the ringleader of thedisorder, as if by accident, and seizes him. Thus victory is achieved. But inabolishing abuses one must not be too hasty. This would turn out badly becausethe abuses have been in existence so long.

</div><div class="line" id="4">
 Six in the fourth place means: <p>He penetrates the left side of the belly.  One gets at the very heart of the darkening of the light.<p> We find ourselves close to the commander of darkness and so discover his motsecret thoughts. In this way we realize that there is no longer any hope ofimprovement, and thus we are enabled to leave the scene of disaster before thestorm breaks. 

</div><div class="line" id="5">
 Six in the fifth place means: <p>Darkening of the light as with Prince Chi.  Perseverance furthers.<p> Prince Chi lived at the court of the evil tyrant Chou Hsin, who, althoughnot mentioned by name, furnished the historical example on which this wholesituation is based. Prince Chi was a relative of the tyrant and could notwithdraw from the court; therefore he concealed his true sentiments andfeigned insanity. Although he was held a slave, he did not allow externalmisery to deflect him from his convictions. This provides a teaching for thosewho cannot leave their posts in times of darkness. In order to escape danger,they need invincible perseverance of spirit and redoubled caution in theirdealings with the world.

</div><div class="line" id="6">
 Six at the top means: <p>Not light but darkness.  First he climbed up to heaven,<p> Then plunged into the depths of the earth.<p> Here the climax of the darkening is reached. The dark power at first held sohigh a place that it could wound all who were on the side of good and of thelight. But in the end it perishes of its own darkness, for evil must itselffall at the very moment when it has wholly overcome the good, and thusconsumed the energy to which it owed its duration.
